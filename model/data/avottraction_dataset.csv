"Re-considering 1st paragraph edit? I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily """"wrong."""" Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject. I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly """"enhanced;"""" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists. A1. Benjamin Cardozo A2. Learned Hand

B1. John Marshall Harlan B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point.

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

"::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims """"despite """"Third Way"""" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force""""? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a """"Third Way"""" as the references show.

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible.

"Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ""probabilities"". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ""well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ""B"" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if ""A"" were a dead body and ""B"" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, ""A"", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed ""B"". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

"Transliterating Russian place names into another language like Malayalam can be quite complex due to phonetic differences. Here are some suggestions for transliterating ""Park Kultury"":

1. **Park Kultury** - It is commonly pronounced as [pʲark kulˈtʊrɨ].  
   - The first word ""Park"" can be transliterated as **PAARK**.  
   - The second word ""Kultury"" is a bit tricky, but the pronunciation is closer to **KUL-TU-RY**. The letter 'U' is pronounced like 'oo' in 'good' and 'R' is a rolled sound. 
   - You may consider transliterating it as **PAARK KUL-TU-RY** (the 'TU' sounding like 'tue') or **PAARK KULTHURY** (to emphasize the 'THR' sound).

"Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.",0,0,0,0

"Attributing and classifying of personalities is a complex task that often involves the interplay of various ideological systems and cultural contexts. The cultural renaissance in Lithuania, particularly in the early 20th century, presents a unique case study of how modernism can be understood diversely depending on local versus global perspectives. Líthuanian modernists like Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis not only embraced modernist ideals but also sought to express and preserve Lithuanian cultural heritage while engaging with ideas from Western Europe. This dual role of exporting Lithuanian culture to the West while innovating within a local context highlights the rich and intricate landscape of cultural development during that period. The challenges of classifying these individuals as modernists or traditionalists are further complicated by historical contexts, including the impact of Soviet governance that often led to a conflation of these categories. Understanding these nuances is essential for a comprehensive grasp of Lithuania's cultural identity and evolution during a pivotal era in its history.",0,0,0,0

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.

"Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the ""back story"" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).

"66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ""primitive"" and ""rural"" (even ""fashist"") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ""performed"" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another ""apostle"" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ""gusle players"". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book ""Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.  
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ""Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0,0,0,0

"The term ""Angika region"" can refer to an area where the Angika language is traditionally spoken, which may not strictly align with the official language designations of the districts within Jharkhand. The classification of a region as Angika could be based on cultural, historical, or linguistic heritage rather than the modern official languages recognized for administrative purposes. Therefore, while the official languages in these districts may be Hindi or Santali, the presence of Angika speakers in the region and cultural practices tied to the Angika language contribute to its designation as such. This nuanced distinction often leads to confusion, as linguistic identification may not always match official language policies. A clarification about how regions are defined linguistically versus administratively would be helpful in understanding this complexity.",0,0,0,0
"The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question ""Do you want to turn the Government out?"" said ""Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

"Biased, unreliable,emotionally written by armenin wiki editors== Pls, stop using the wikipedia for your dirty propaganda and lobbying purposes. There was no genocide.

"Smer-SD is a social democratic political party in Slovakia, traditionally representing leftist and socialist values. However, they have been characterized by their populist approach and have often focused on nationalism, which can sometimes create inconsistencies with their historical association with broader socialist and social democratic frameworks, such as in the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (PES). The party's current association with non-inscrits, or non-attached members in the European Parliament, could be due to their distancing from traditional socialist groups in favor of a more nationalist agenda, which has made it challenging for them to align fully with the PES or other progressive groups internationally. This reflects a broader trend where parties modify their stances or political identities in response to changing political landscapes and voter bases, and in Smer-SD's case, it appears they are navigating a balance between leftist ideals and nationalist rhetoric. This has consequently placed them in a more ambiguous political position within European parliamentary factions.",0,0,0,0

"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.",0,0,0,0

"Bill is the son of a prominent figure in the business world, who rose to become the CEO of Commonwealth Edison, a leading energy company in the Midwest. His father began his career in the company in the early 1970s and quickly demonstrated a talent for management and strategic planning. Over the years, he held various positions within the organization, including operational and executive roles, which laid the foundation for his ascent to the top of the company.

Through a combination of visionary leadership and a strong understanding of the energy sector, Bill's father was appointed CEO in the late 1990s. Under his guidance, Commonwealth Edison underwent significant transformations, focusing on modernization and sustainability initiatives to adapt to the evolving energy landscape. His tenure was marked by efforts to improve customer service, reduce environmental impact, and navigate regulatory challenges. These accomplishments not only solidified his position within the company but also reinforced Commonwealth Edon's reputation in the industry.

In terms of what I said about the age - I didn't mean to cause offense. I thought I read somewhere that you had to be over 18 to make these decisions but I think I was getting confused with the check user privileges.

From what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what I was expecting.

I really don't have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what I have said. For example one user just wrote there is another site called Amirite.net. This is Amirite.com!! This is precisely why I had to keep responding on the AFC delete page.

"""Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favor. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisdictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive difference between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. Saying that DLA has """" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China,..."""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"in major financial centres"""" or """"in major commercial centres"""" or """"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecessary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research. I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.""",0,0,0,0

"Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia.

"Yes, it is generally correct to say that in projectile motion, a 45-degree launch angle (assuming ideal conditions with no air resistance) will yield the maximum range for a projectile. However, to address your specific question: while a 30-degree shot will not reach the same range as a 60-degree shot because of the difference in their effective ranges, the distinction between direct fire and indirect fire based solely on these angles can be somewhat analogous but not strictly accurate in all scenarios. 

1. **Projectile Range:** In an ideal vacuum, the maximum range is achieved at 45 degrees. Shots launched at angles less than 45 degrees (like 30 degrees) will have a more horizontal trajectory, while angles greater than 45 degrees (like 60 degrees) provide a steeper ascent and descent. The distances covered by each angle depend not just on angle, but also initial velocity.
  
2. **Direct vs. Indirect Fire:** Generally, direct fire refers to a projectile that travels in a line-of-sight trajectory (low angle), while indirect fire involves a trajectory that goes above the line of sight (higher angle). A 30-degree shot could be considered more direct since it's closer to horizontal, while a 60-degree shot would be seen as indirect due to its steep ascent. However, whether a 45-degree trajectory falls into direct or indirect fire can depend on the context and specific definitions used in military terms.

Thus, your analogy can work as a way to visualize these categories, but the actual physics of projectile motion is a bit more complex because range also tightly ties to initial velocity and other factors. It's a great perspective for framing discussions about angles and types of projectile trajectories, but should be approached with the understanding that it's not definitive across all scenarios.",0,0,0,0

"Bonnie Prince Charlie, or Charles Edward Stuart, is often mischaracterized in Whig history as a proponent of separating Scotland from the Union with England. However, a closer examination reveals that he actually sought to restore the Stuart line to the throne, which would not have inherently dissolved the Union formed in 1707. In fact, Charles envisioned a united Britain under his rightful claim as the legitimate heir to the throne, as opposed to the Hanoverians. 

Whig historians, driven by their political agendas, have often portrayed the Stuart dynasty as failures devoid of positive contributions to British history. They label Bonnie Prince Charlie as a naive romantic, undermining the claim that he recognized the complexities of British governance and aimed for a united realm. It is important to note that the Stuarts did not simply culminate in the Jacobite rebellions; their reign introduced pivotal developments, notably in religious tolerance and the cultivation of the arts and culture, laying foundational elements of British identity. They were, in essence, the custodians of the unity amongst England, Scotland, and Ireland during their reign. 

Furthermore, it's crucial to challenge the assertion that the Hanoverians are the rightful lineage for the Union. Several Hanoverian heirs themselves acknowledge the integral role of the Stuarts in forming the United Kingdom. The idea that the Parliamentarians would dismiss the Sovereign's will, emphasizing their preference for a parliamentary republic, further solidifies the importance of recognizing the monarch's role in a unified Britain. Without the recognition of the Stuarts as the legitimate rulers, one could argue that the British existence would risk devolving into a mere parliamentary system devoid of monarchical authority.

In retrospect, the narrative around the Stuarts is a product of Whig history that seeks to vilify them while positioning the Hanoverians as the rightful heirs to a celebrated legacy. This simplification does a disservice to the rich tapestry of British history that acknowledges the contributions and aspirations of all rulers, including the Stuarts, in the enduring framework of the United Kingdom. 

In essence, the real historical debate is not about the dissolution of the Union by Bonnie Prince Charlie but recognizing how again, the Stuarts laid the groundwork for a realms' vision that included a united kingdom – a vision that echoes through history, even as the political narratives evolve. 

In conclusion, the discourse around Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Stuart legacy deserves a reevaluation to appreciate the deeper historical narrative that binds the realms of Great Britain, one where the Sovereign's will indeed remains paramount to the identity of the kingdom.",0,0,0,0

1) Is it proper in the context of the article (useful, tasteful, informative, factual, etc.)?  
2) Is it a functional link, and likely to continue being a functional link?  
3) Each link should be considered on its merits, using the following guidelines. As the number of external links in an article grows longer, assessment should become stricter.

"stradbroke galleon / portuguese

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by ""mainstream"" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the ""mainstream"" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.",0,0,0,0

"Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ""betrayed"" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue.

Your (typical) problem is that you are being too literal.  The term Personal Union is a very special, and limited Constitutional term.  It refers to two or more States (i.e., countries) that recognise the same Monarch as there Head of State, however their is no UNION OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS.  Some examples are,

(i).  The Union of Kalmar (1397).   Its members were the Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.  This gave rise to the termUnited Scandinavia.  In 1562 (I believe) Sweden left the Union.

"Speedy deletion of Phi Rho Eta
A tag has been placed on Phi Rho Eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement ""I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here.

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.",0,0,0,0

"Greek love

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available, so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.

Wow, that is a mess. Certainly no hard feelings on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake. It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

"My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"pro se"""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"soap boxing"""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think.

"DECT isn't really a new technology. It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT. DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously.

As I believe I've said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it. That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked. There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT's dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.",0,0,0,0

"For situations like this, it's important to engage calmly and assertively. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Document Everything**: Keep a record of the edits that Baki66 has reverted along with any comments made to you that could be considered ethnic mudslinging. This documentation can be valuable in any discussions or reports you may need to make.

2. **Engage Politely**: If you haven't already, try reaching out to Baki66 directly. Explain your edits and ask for clarification on why he disagrees. Sometimes, a direct conversation can help clear misunderstandings.

3. **Seek Consensus**: Try to involve other users to get their opinions on the edits. Sometimes having a third party can help mediate disputes. You can ask on the article’s talk page for input from others.

4. **Use Talk Pages**: If the edits are contested, it may be best to discuss them on the article’s talk page rather than engaging in an edit war. Lay out your reasoning clearly and invite others to contribute to the discussion.

5. **Report the Behavior**: If Baki66 is engaging in ethnic mudslinging, this is against most community guidelines. Consider reporting him to the administrators or the relevant moderation team. Provide your documented evidence for review.

6. **Stay Calm and Professional**: It can be frustrating to deal with conflict, but try to stay focused on resolving the issue without escalating it further. Maintaining professionalism will reflect well on you in any discussions with others regarding the situation. 

7. **Consider Seeking Help from Admins**: If the situation doesn't improve, don’t hesitate to reach out to the site administrators for assistance or clarification on what to do next.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless. You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that. We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0. To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1). And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.) Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]!  Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])). Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0,0,0,0

"Lol, you know what i meant. Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense.

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected. Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).",0,0,0,0

"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?75.162.211.81

"Bakan

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article? Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang. In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject. She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors. Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified. Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

"Bloc voting

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91]

This is full-blown crazy. What does ""non-nationals"" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. It's the language and sensibility.",0,0,0,0

"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0,0,0,0

It is impossible to ""exhibit a battleground attitude"" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot ""exhibit"" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to ""exhibit"" anything let alone a ""battleground attitude,"" the fact that there is no such thing as a ""battleground attitude,"" the fact that there is no such thing as an ""attitude"" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word ""exhibit"" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like ""exhibit"" and ""attitude"", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED ""help desk"" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly ""myself making it difficult to communicate,"" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to ""disable the private messaging system."")

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"" is impossible since 1) ""guidelines"" and ""rules"" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was ""done in multiple venues,"" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.",0,0,1,0

"""July 2006 (UTC) Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, ""Joe at worms"" then we write ""Joe ate worms"". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call ""policy and ""guidelines"" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there.

Having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years, and now as a student in law school, I am convinced from what I know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film, and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the ABC news team for the release of their story.

"And 

Paganism 

Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party. Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins. Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’. Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II. 

This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’. The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’. For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’. 

Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene. This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth. Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement. Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’. Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews. 

This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’. Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.

"Addition of history

As can be seen, I have added a new history section for the Bank of Liverpool - previously there were just a few lines of intro. I have taken it up to 1918, when the Bank acquired Martins Bank and became the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.

I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.

How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article. One solution would be to have Martins pre-1918 history as a self-contained article with the Bank of Liverpool article continuing up to 1969.",0,0,0,0
"""OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""" that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

"Justin Vaisse's opinion this relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the French. Pierre Verdaguer, ""A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003. Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america.

Why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property?  Google returns 75,400 results for ""specific modulus"", 78,700 results for ""specific stiffness"", and 783,000 results for ""stiffness to weight ratio"".

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term ""specific modulus"", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.",0,0,0,0

Blu,

I noticed you changed the logo for the Ubuntu Linux User Box.  Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about """"fair use"""" images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy. The Ubuntu trademark policy may allow it, but Wikipedia policy (per WP:FU is to limit images that are not available for commercial use - which the Ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows.  | (talk) | (contribs)  The preceding text was copied from User talk:Jcarroll

"Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states ""all rights reserved"".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as ""all rights reserved"".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states ""all rights reserved"".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).
:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",0,0,0,0

Hi HJ. In the message you left on my talk page (here), you explained your reasoning for not protecting the relevant articles.

The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing.

"How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games ""SHALL NOT"" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither ""contained"" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN.

"The discussion surrounding the changes to the Palpatine intro on Wikipedia reflects a common debate in collaborative writing environments over the balance between detail, neutrality, and readability. Here’s an analysis based on several points:

1. **Length vs. Conciseness**: Your version prioritizes brevity, which aligns with typical Wikipedia guidelines favoring succinctness. The previous versions introduced more adjectives and broader descriptive phrases that could detract from clarity and directness.

2. **Neutral Point of View (NPOV)**: Wikipedia's content guidelines emphasize neutrality. Terms like ""absolute leader of the most crushing totalitarian government"" lean towards an opinionated description rather than a factual representation of Palpatine's role, which could violate NPOV standards. Your version maintains a more neutral tone by focusing on titles and roles without subjective language.

3. **Clarity and Readability**: Your revision captures the essence of Palpatine's character arc without excessive detail, making it easier for readers to quickly grasp his significance in the Star Wars saga. Many would prefer a straightforward introduction that succinctly presents key facts, which you have successfully provided.

4. **Historical Context**: While mentioning the Clone Wars is crucial to understanding Palpatine's rise to power, the richness of his character could be briefly acknowledged without overcomplicating the introduction. Keeping the mention of his transition from Chancellor to Emperor ties his ascendance together without unnecessary expansions.

Overall, your version aligns well with Wikipedia's intent to provide clear, factual, and succinct entries, adhering to the NPOV and allowing readers to understand Palpatine's importance in a straightforward manner. It would be beneficial to gather varied opinions from more editors for consensus, especially focusing on adherence to Wikipedia guidelines and reader clarity.",0,0,0,0

Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say ""article"") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions.

And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a ""denialist""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an ""expert."" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not ""article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not ""article"") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the ""so what?"" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too.

This indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as 1:6000 (Webb et al. 1993, Cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis, Arch Dis Child 68:367–70)

Earlier, when talking about Hunt and Lindenbaum's 1984 study, he says """"The scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be."""" I don't have that paper so don't have more details.

An editorial by Fryer (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1991, 84:699) says """"... suggesting a birth incidence of 1:10000"""". I don't have the Osborne paper you mention. I've seen 1:5800 mentioned but don't know its source at present.

My sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. I'm happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.

"Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows the limited use of copyrighted material without needing to seek permission from the rights holders. The violation of fair use can hinge on several factors, including the purpose of use (commercial vs. educational), the nature of the work used, the amount of the work used, and the effect of the use on the market value of the original work. 

To address the potential violations:
1. Specify what ten elements or guidelines were violated, such as the amount of copyrighted material used, whether the use was transformative, and if it harmed the market for the original work.
2. Identify which images were used without rationales and provide concrete examples to illustrate this point so necessary adjustments can be made.
3. Detail the necessary changes to the images in question, which may include obtaining proper licensing, editing to use less of the work, or providing a clear educational or transformative purpose to support fair use arguments.  

In summary, providing clarity on each of these aspects will help address the concerns of fair use violation and outline a pathway for compliance and retention of the images.",0,0,0,0

"deleted response to comments on wikipedia talk:Wikiproject Ships

Please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. 

In this particular case, the discussion was started by user Brad, who made a personal comment about me. Now, I dont mind this, I was more curious than offended, but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which I started on Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)‎. You claimed that my post which you deleted was a 'POV inserted into a neutral notice'. It may have been a POV, about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later, but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work, and thus the implicit POV that it was undesireable. It was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting.  If you are going to start censoring postings, then I would suggest you do so impartially.  You did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice, but merely removed one comment. Rather than restoring impartiality, this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.

"Pretty much what I said the first day this was posted. Now, I have neither a problem with the Cabal's decision nor in the Cabal's logic (as Deamon138 does). My concern is why a vote that basically said """"I don't know"""" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. Choice 4 just doesn't look that appealing.",0,0,0,0

I agree that information in the lead should be in the article under the relevant section, perhaps as the opening paragraph, but given there are already articles for religious practices, it is unnecessary in the lead. It could be reduced to one, or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical, cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision - but without going into detail. This is a medical article, and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision. Only where medical circumcision has itself become part of cultural practice should there be a focus on that manifestation of circumcision as cultural practice.",0,0,0,0

"In your analysis, you've pointed out the nuances and complexities of language usage in different contexts. This provides valuable insight into how terms can be interpreted and perceived differently across cultures. Your mention of 'Pakeha' as a term that some find pejorative highlights the importance of context and the evolution of language within societal norms. Additionally, your analysis of the statistics regarding mentions of 'rooster' versus 'cockerel' raises a valid concern about the relevance and clarity of data, especially when it comes from sources that may be influenced by competing interests, such as rugby. Overall, your observations emphasize the need for careful consideration of terminology and the subtle implications behind common phrases, especially in media reporting. It suggests a more informed approach to writing that respects the diverse views within a population while also recognizing the potential for misinterpretation in statistical reporting. 

In terms of the importance of these distinctions: it underscores the necessity for journalists and writers to be aware of the terms they use and their connotations, which can vary widely based on audience perception. It's crucial to consider how language can shape narrative and inform public discourse, especially in multicultural societies. It appears that any discussion around terminology should prioritize clarity, sensitivity, and inclusivity, going beyond mere statistical counts to engage with the lived experiences of individuals within those demographics.",0,0,0,0

- Comment on CSD A7 reflecting on unremarkability; queries if this is the AfD reason (Edward Wakelin).
- User:chandrannair defends Ivy Goh Nair's notability due to established presence in Singapore literature despite inter-editing concerns.

"""RSA Labss (Now EMC), MIT, and ACM are wrong? VQuaker. I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing. I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious. Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia. If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas. Further, """"someone you know"""" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance. Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat. Though, I suspect you know this already. I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard. I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person? There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay.

When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell? Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema. Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach. What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone. Smell? Non-sequitur.

I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies? Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.

2) The section you quote from WP:NAME is in the section titled ""Use English words"", which goes on to say ""Sometimes the usual English version will differ somewhat from the local form as in Franz Josef Strauss; and rarely, as with Mount Everest, it will be completely different."" This is clearly a case where the ""usual English version"" differs somewhat.
3) Wikipedia:Naming conventions (political parties) carries several exceptions: the third exception is ""Parties whose name is more commonly known by acronyms than their full name in international newsmedia."" Since GPV is more commonly known by its acronym, this naming convention does not apply.

"Tangential Forces 

The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.

During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.

We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.

In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.

In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.

Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.

More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.

They they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.",0,0,0,0

Sure, they use the teleological argument, but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isn't pseudoscience, which is what irks me as a scientist.  But I don't understand theology (probably because I've been trained to think too scientifically).

"Joan of Arc's sword is shrouded in mystery and historical intrigue. According to various historical accounts, Joan was said to have had a sword, which she believed was divinely provided to her. After her death, some of her belongings, including letters and a sword, were kept by her family. However, details about the specific sword she used are quite vague, and it's believed that different swords may have been attributed to her over time.

One sword that is often discussed is purported to be the one Joan used during her military campaigns. Reports suggest that it may have been discovered in 1430, and it was characterized by its ornate design, possibly featuring inscriptions and a unique pommel. However, many items associated with Joan have been lost or destroyed over the years, leading to uncertainty about their whereabouts.

As of now, the most well-known sword attributed to her is housed in the historical collections, but the original sword she carried into battle has not been definitively found or verified. Therefore, the answer to whether it has been rediscovered remains elusive. 

In conclusion, while some descendants claimed to have possessions of her sword, its true fate remains ambiguous, and there is no consensus on its current existence or appearance. Joan of Arc's sword continues to be a fascinating topic of research, and historians continue to search for more definitive accounts of its history and legacy.",0,0,0,0

Social therapy does absolutely nothing to cure (or properly treat) people with mental illness.

"Legal Action Pending == I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least. 216.24.206.155",0,0,0,0

"""Untitled Also see: infobox vote Codes and """"minor"""" state Please stop Since there is no definition of a """"minor"""" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess. It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. ( ) Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. ( ) What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC) Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality.

What kind of site are you people trying to run here?!

 It's no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when it's become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. I have continuously been censored for editing a biased article- an article which is continuously edited by self-avowed marxists and anti-zionists (the very same people whose POV the article unashamedly puts forward). What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication- but it's quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. 

 In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why.

"Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example. Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of ""He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."" Adding ""to some of the generation"" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in ""Inertia Coupling"" or ""Alexander Abian"" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place ""to come as you are,"" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute.

"Elelland - Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a ""kangaroo court"" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

"Managua, the Epicenter of Crime in Nicaragua

Managua has seen a significant rise in violence and criminal activities throughout the 1990s. The reasons behind the violent crime in Managua can be attributed to several factors, including political strife, civil war repercussions, and general delinquency.

Gangs have emerged as a prevalent issue in Managua, marking a rapidly growing phenomenon. Currently, the city hosts over 110 gangs, boasting more than 8,000 members. These gangs are responsible for approximately 50% of all crimes occurring in Nicaragua and 60% of all incidents within Managua. The presence of violence and gang warfare has become an alarming reality. These gangs are implicated in various crimes, including theft, mugging, pickpocketing, and they also engage in the drug trade, among other illicit activities.",0,0,0,0

"There is definately a major difference between caucasian and white.  Users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article, and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view (cited sources or not, it's obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite, and or choose not to), but this article as it exists is just wrong.  I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2009",0,0,0,0

"""Addressing: While 'Indian tribe' is official US Gov't lingo, saying 'tribe' twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward, also 'the tribe' is not a monolithic entity, but rather a collection of people - so maybe reword to say something like 'The Coeur d'Alene people once inhabited 3,500,000 acres (1,400,000 ha) in northern Idaho and Washington,(And Montana, actually, note article on the tribe) but today, the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Benewah and Kootenai counties, Idaho.' You don't have to use my wording, but you see how I am distinguishing land and people, though the two are, of course, closely intertwined. Boom! Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway? Keep the chronology clearer. (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter. The section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining, maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the SCOTUS case."",",0,0,0,0

""", 20 September 2011 (UTC) I'll try to take the points in turn. Hope I get this format right. - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful. - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual.

On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation.

"Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation. In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'. While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is ""now occurring"") are not fossils. From the ""Dictionary of Geologic Terms"", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protect them long enough so they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationists today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: ""They control our systems of information."" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia. At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy. What, if anything, is presently being done? I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to ""prove"" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest. Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was? I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.

"My 2c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic, find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a Criticisms section.  Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.

"This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article

Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word """"x86"""", for the following reasons:

1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally """"x86"""" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with """"86"""", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as """"x86"""" are IA-32 compatible software, and use """"x64"""" or """"x86-64"""" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word.

2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?

3. """"x86"""" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! """"x86"""" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the """"implementation"""" of this """"architecture""""?",0,0,0,0

"Amcom article

Hi

Earlier today I noticed that there is no article on Amcom, and I posted on the Amnet talk page, before moving it to talk:Amcom (because although the network is called Amnet, the actual company is called Amcom).
I didn't realize until later that there was already an Amcom (actually Amnet) page that had been deleted. After reading the explanation for the deletion, I'm not sure whether Amcom really has enough notability or not. However, if we do want to make an Amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.

If you are still interested, take a look at this article I found:

"This needs an additional citation for the first part ([2] only refers to him now being labelled a cheat). Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much. 

In summary I think that the line should be changed to:

"(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0,0,0,0

"Alex, thank you for your reply. I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against me during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the ""judgment on content"" aspect of the FoF, it begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion. Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page. The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about ""the court of public opinion"". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is ""outing"", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue. There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday. If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑",0,0,1,0

For reference, I will repost and expand them here.

1. Jimbo Wales has to leave. He should turn over the server admin passwords to a professional, 
   responsible IT person who is salaried by the WMF.

2. Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. 
   Changes would include but not be limited to:
   
   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.
   
   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO. 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking to
      write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. ""Assume good faith"" my ass.
   
   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.

3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
   banned from WP PERMANENTLY. This would include but not be limited to:
      FT2
      Durova
      David Gerard

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google ""South Ossetia War"". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title ""SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA"" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the ""2008 Georgia War"" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased.

Hello. I have reverted your edit to Operation Bagration again.

If you want to include Krivosheev's figures, then add a sentence along the lines of ""G. F. Krivosheev, however, places the Soviet losses much higher, at 178,507 killed...""

"Further edits have persisted adding ""citation needed"" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

"Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no ""South Asian sensitivities"". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of ""greatness"". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as ""obnoxious"", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

"Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this: Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a ""name"" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article. Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as ""2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name. Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching ""please categorise these pages"" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess. Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved. As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk",0,0,0,0

"The three types of geothermal energy are: 1. **Dry Steam Power Plants**: These plants use steam extracted directly from geothermal reservoirs to turn turbines and generate electricity. 2. **Flash Steam Power Plants**: These plants take high-pressure hot water from the ground and allow it to 'flash' into steam when pressure is reduced, which is then used to turn turbines. 3. **Binary Cycle Power Plants**: This type uses lower temperature geothermal resources. Hot water heats a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then vaporizes and drives a turbine.",0,0,0,0
"Mary Walker, an American surgeon and women's rights advocate, is primarily known for her work during the Civil War as a surgeon for the Union Army. While she did not contribute to scientific discoveries in the traditional sense of laboratory research, her contributions to medicine and the field of surgery are noteworthy. She was the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States from Syracuse Medical College in 1855. Additionally, Walker is known for her pioneering role in advocating for women’s roles in medicine, encouraging the acceptance of women in the medical profession, and fighting for women's rights, which indirectly shaped the future landscape of healthcare and medical practices for women. In summary, while she may not have made scientific discoveries, her role in advancing medical practice for women and her contributions as a physician during a time of war were significant in the context of both medicine and academic inclusion.",0,0,0,0

The relationship between Rusyn and Ukrainian languages is indeed complex, with both sharing a Slavic heritage, which can lead to misunderstandings regarding identity, as you mentioned about your father's experience. It is common for individuals from specific ethnic backgrounds, like the Rusyns, to prefer distinct identification apart from broader national labels such as 'Ukrainian.' 

For a historical context on the Rusyn-Ukrainian identity debate during the Cold War era, a reliable source might be the work by scholars such as John D. Bell (1981) *The Ukrainian-Polish Borderlands: A Historical Overview* or Paul R. Magocsi's *The People of Ukraine: A Historical Dictionary* (1996). These texts explore the complex interrelations of these ethnic groups and provide insights into their distinct identities during politically charged times.

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

I've listed this article for peer review because, even though I and other editors have contributed much information and references, I'm certain that there are other aspects of this classic film that have yet to be covered. I'd like to hear feedback from you, so that I can get help in improving this (and other Marx Brothers films) quality.
Princess Leia Organa. I've listed this article for peer review because it right now seems oddly cluttered and, despite a lot of references as of now, lacks reliable source citations. Although I've already requested another peer review, as long as it helps the articles get better, I've got the time. Any helpful comments will certainly be appreciated, as this should help me in expanding other Star Wars-centric articles.

"MATIA, I have told you a hundred times that articles on dialects do NOT have the word language in the title. Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. Arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy. The world is not made to please you, neither is Wikipedia. We have policies that must be observed, so if you want to use Wikipedia, you will just have to accept them. Regards   (PS does peace mean having to violate WP policies?

"There are indeed cultural practices in various regions that can resemble the concept of kidnapping men for marriage, often rooted in traditional customs or social constructs. Here are a few examples:  

1. **Abduction Marriages**: This practice is prevalent in several cultures around the world, including in parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. For example, in Kyrgyzstan, it is not uncommon for a man to abduct a woman and then convince her to marry him.  

2. **Bride Kidnapping in Africa**: In some African tribes, bride kidnapping does occur, where a groom might take a bride by force, though this is often done with the hope that she will eventually accept the marriage. Such practices can be observed in regions of Ethiopia, among others.  

3. **Cossack Traditions**: Among Cossack communities in Russia and Ukraine, there have been historical practices where men would carry off women to marry them, often justified by cultural traditions.  

4. **Gaza Strip**: In certain communities in the Gaza Strip, kidnapping for marriage has been reported, where marriage negotiations might lead to abduction if a man feels rejected.  

5. **Kidnapping for Marriage in the Balkans**: In some parts of the Balkans, kidnapping for marriage has been a tradition, although it is becoming less common today.  

Many of these practices, while they have historical or cultural significance, are increasingly being challenged and criticized in modern societies. Laws and social movements are working toward the eradication of these traditions in favor of more consensual forms of marriage.",0,0,0,0

For instance, the work of political scientists and cultural analysts can yield empirical evidence regarding the implications of these comparisons; they analyze subjects such as political systems, healthcare, education, and public attitudes towards government and individual freedoms. I recommend searching through academic databases like JSTOR or Google Scholar for papers focusing on cross-national comparisons between France and the US, especially within political science or cultural studies frameworks.

As a close follower of the language-political issues in Finland, I have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongue's significance in defining what, if you will, we could call ""ethnic identity"" especially when it comes to Finnish-speakers. Swedish-speakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century, when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having ""two languages"", which from individual people's mother-tongue point of view is patent nonsense  the mother tongue of, say, my entire family tree is Finnish and what Swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. Whatever happens in the future, our language policy has not yet managed to implant Swedish as a general second language in the population, and this must be taken into account here. I can well understand how Fenno-Swedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered ""Finnish"", but there is always the flipside of such a coin.   13:39, 21 August 2009",0,0,0,0

"Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about ""between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.

Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.

It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony. Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones. I'm aware of the substantial history of Iona-based clerics in Bernicia, but times change (and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons).

The translation of Pehthelm's name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flat-out, so have a look at the reference cited; I tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed, you should be able to quickly access every citation that I made in the article.

A source that is not listed as an inline citation in an article is not a reference, it does not point to any specific text in the article. It is ""further reading"" material unless it can be used to verify text.

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is ""References""; other articles use ""Notes"", ""Footnotes"", or ""Works cited"" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title ""References"" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""Sources"", ""Citations"", ""Bibliography"") may also be used, although each is problematic: ""Sources"" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; ""Citations"" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; ""Bibliography"" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of ""Bibliography,"" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list.

"European Borders
There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not. As you know there is no official border between Europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions. So you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page.......... well sadly that's not what most editors think. They put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. Now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definitely offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she ""thinks it is the most neutral one"". I am sorry but what some users ""think"" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. They should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in Europe, classifies country as European; country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only European countries are eligible for it according to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. Turkey is not the case because it was already a member of NATO. Can't they understand that page is not about the EU? It's the entire Europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included. I really want to ask someone to take care of it as they don't seem to understand my very logical argument and even used some rude words in private messages.",0,0,0,0

"A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following: the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users. Regardless of any ""Ukrainian military"" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the ""Ukrainian"" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on ""trading the truth"".

While the theoretical foundation may not always be explicitly stated, it is often derived from empirical studies and is context-dependent based on specific solvent-solute systems. The trial and error approach is indeed a practical method for determining this parameter, as it allows researchers to assess the solubility of materials in various solvents and infer the interaction strengths that govern dissolution behavior.

"Changes to this Page - Open discussion == Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to ""be bold"" and start a ""démenagement"" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the ""general concensus"" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling. My goal here is not to ""control"" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved. The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general ""Paris"" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for ""Paris economy"" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for ""Paris history"" or ""paris fashion"". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below. In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only ""Paris"" into the search window - I propose to move the more ""specialty"" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a ""specialty"" page of its own.

This page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish, which simply need changing and then leaving alone.

I have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which I wish to place on here, knowing full well that 5 minutes later, the fools that wish to write things they know little about, or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become CD, will desperately alter the content.  

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts. People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them. But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow. 3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”. Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future.  

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",0,0,0,0

"First off, modern computer-generated ornate renderings of the Paleo-Hebrew YHUH/YHWH and Modern Hebrew Tetragrammaton were added in the article, anyway. Mine were of anthropological resources [My friend, Prof. James Greenberg, University of Phoenix Anthropologist].

The ""W"" in ""YHWH"" was not intended to represent not of the ""yod"" as the ancestry but of the ancestry of Roman W back to the Aramaic U and then the Paleo Y.

The transliteration of the en vowel [U] whether  a [u] vowel or [ǖ] vowel, instead of [vv]or [w] consonant and the better pronunciation. (For example ability for pronunciation of the Greek letter Upsilon changed in sound-value from a [u] vowel to an umlaut or front-rounded [ǖ] vowel was relevant to the Tetragrammaton as far as the representation by many that there are no vowels in the tetragrammaton.

 And third, ""Yahusha"" [as in the same tetragrammaton of Yahshua ref. Strong's Concordance ""sha"" for Deliverer and ""shua"" for ""scream"" or ""cry""] does existed in Hebrew, so is NOT completely bogus as a supposed historical divine name...

I think WP rules allow us to express concern that the cite of a vague assertion that somebody """"heard the N-word"""" is problematic from a WP:BLP standpoint.  If multiple BLM protestors claim that they heard one of the (white) visitors say the N-word, and it was cited from some reliable source, that would probably change my opinion.

On the third hand, we do get some no-hopers on the face of it, which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article, and then delete undeveloped entries as non-notable. In the second case, we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability, because it may be that interested editors are lacking; that's why the month moratorium seems to exist, as far as I can tell. andemu",0,0,1,0

"Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of ""soapboxing"".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to ""soapboxing"" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the ""investment predictions for 2008"" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, ""soap-like"".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that ""soapboxing""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, ""What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading ""Heeeeelp"".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: ""Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page:  

""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on ""Monetary Crankery""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or ""satirizing"" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more ""editing"".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called ""cannabis culture"" and ""the Buddhist connection with marijuana"".  So, I gather from this that his main ""interests"" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as ""soapboxing"".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).

 ""At the close of the twentieth century, ""Canadian"" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this ""indigenous"" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in ""Canadian"" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.",0,0,0,0

"""Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona. Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you. Peter III of Aragon. What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what 'contemporary' means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are: it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime. The coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might. The silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format. It is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait. The later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative. What makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king. In your last edit summary, you ask 'if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait', but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer. Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria. You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information. I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other. If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time. I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine? Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century? Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me. Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right. Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia. I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will.

"Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prison in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre-torture versions  of what the camp did.",0,0,0,0
"As I suspected, complete nonsense. Your statement is so silly that I can't begin to tell you how wrong it is. You said, ""You there presume that your not-yet-filed Arbcom case has been decided"". I assure you that this was not the case - I would consider that to be a stupid assumption. I am not a stupid person. I would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part, and withdraw everything on this page based on your mind-reading trick. You quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the ""lack the intellectual ability comment"" By the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me, your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack. If it wasn't so silly I would spend time thinking more on it, which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack. Here's a few points for you to think on.

WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles. Then let's consider the ArbCom an article. What then is this articles content? Hmm, let's see … the ArbCom is an article, so what is the ArbCom made of? Why, members. So that means the content of the committee is it's members. So an election is a decision on the content of this article. So. Members are editors, so content is editors, so in order to write this article we must discuss the content. We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content. You don't like that? WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles. But ArbCom is not an article. It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee. We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee. We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions. Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential. Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed. Your threats of blocks I regard as an attempt to bully. Do not try to bully me. Finally I would contrast the participation of admin's in this ANI with the marshalling of forces which you participated in, and then came here. ",0,0,0,0

"No JP is not a good source and I will remove it pending a better source. My Issue is JP has an agenda. I came across them when checking the edit which one editor put in. But They seemed very keen on JP when one editor used it to say Muslims were a tiny tiny percentage. (i never knew JP up until then). See the edit history for this edit. Now here is what I do know. Go and look at all the notable Seer, start with NDour, what is his religion? 100% Muslim. What I am realizing is most Serer are Muslim people. Synergistic is not unique to Africa, it is in every corner of the planet where Islam and Christianity live. So Islam accommodates this, all the key historian on Islam say this. especially David Robinson and others. Vodon per Kwami is a good example. Even in the Caribbean google Jesus in the morning Vodon in the evening. These people are classified as Christian.

"Thanks. I am not entirely familiar with the First Austrian Republic awards system, but given the common cross was a service award for a month's service in the Freikorps, and as it was awarded to just about everyone who served, I don't think it should be included.

I propose adding the exact date of the award of the Verleihung der Ehrenbürgerschaft into the text where the award is already mentioned.

Dear Mr. Lawrence or Mr. Ramirez or whoever you may be:

Thank you for your email, but I prefer to keep Wikipedia business on Wikipedia, not in private communication, so I will respond here.

Your email to me requesting your IP address be unblocked failed to instill any trust. You claim to be one person (Lawrence), yet you send me email from an address that clearly belongs to another (Ramirez)? Are all accounts at your organization as compromised as your Wikipedia account has been?

You state ""It is not possible for me to set up another account on another IP address because this is my IP address."" No, it is not your IP address. It belongs to your organization. And your organization has lost the trust of the Wikipedia community, with its history of promotional edits and multiple people accessing the same account.

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

"Put Me Out single
Hello, how are you? I joined wikipedia after some usage and learning of the site to try to add my input and inprove some pages that I knew were missing some information.

"I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly:
 UNSD uses the term  ""statistics divisions""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.)
 You still prefer previous title (i.e. ""United Nations statistical divisions"") to the current one (i.e. ""United Nations geoscheme"")?
 If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following:
 The term ""Statistics Division""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org.
 The term ""statistical divisions""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: ""statistical divisions"" site:un.org
 The term ""statistical divisions""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: ""statistical divisions"" site:un.org
 Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term ""statistical divisions"", or the wrong organization term  ""Statistics Division"" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). 

 I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as ""UN geoscheme"". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:
""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""
""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""
""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""
""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""
""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""

 I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different ""statistical divisions"" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term ""UN geoscheme"" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  ""UN geoscheme"" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 . 

 Moving forwards, since don't have the time nor will to take it to RM, and if you do not have any further couter-evidence or -arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above, I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM.

"Subdivisions in the classification of eudicots, including rosids and asterids, can be complex and sometimes seem arbitrary without a clear explanation of the differences that define them. However, there are key characteristics that help distinguish between these two groups. Below is a summary of notable differences:

1. **Flower Structure**: 
   - Rosids typically have flowers with a high number of petals and are often symmetrical, such as those in the family Rosaceae (roses).
   - Asterids often have fused petals that form a tubular structure, which is characteristic of families like Asteraceae (asters or daisies).

2. **Leaf Arrangement**:  
   - Many rosids exhibit alternate or spiral leaf arrangement, and their leaves can be compound or simple. 
   - Asterids are generally characterized by opposite leaf arrangements and can feature entire or lobed leaves.

3. **Inflorescence Types**:  
   - In rosids, inflorescences are often racemose or panicle-type, showcasing a variety of bloom arrangements.  
   - Asterids typically present a composite flower head (capitulum), which is a cluster of small flowers grouped together, as seen in sunflowers.

4. **Fruit Types**:  
   - Rosids may produce a variety of fruit types including drupes, berries, and pomes, reflecting diverse reproductive strategies.  
   - Asterids are often associated with dry fruits such as achenes, which are small, indehiscent fruits, or samaras.

5. **Chemistry**:  
   - Many rosids are rich in tannins, which can affect taste and ecological interactions.  
   - Asterids often contain essential oils and other secondary metabolites that can have medicinal properties or influence pollination.

By outlining these differences, it helps provide a framework for understanding why certain plants like oaks and roses belong to the rosids, while others like sunflowers and blueberries are categorized as asterids. Each subgroup presents distinct botanical features shaped by evolutionary paths and ecological adaptations.",0,0,0,0

I didn't mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. I didn't violate the final warning; CurtisNaito did (multiple times). The exact wording of the warning was """"If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility, bludgeons a discussion, violates WP:IDHT, acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors, then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours.""""

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

'As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting.

"FK Vardar

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens (Gragjanski in Macedonian) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens (Vardar), the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. 

About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of six Republics - countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz, the marshal of the Federation, and it was called the Cup of the Marshal. However, FC Vardar never won the Federal league (League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams, that's why it's called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade, you can check in any official statistics or documents. 

The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues, East (three Republics competed, Serbia, Monte Negro, Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation, those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship) and West (three Republics, Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia; sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship would compete in the West depending on the federation's decisions). In the period of 1922 till 1929, the present-day Republic of Macedonia was established as four provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those four provinces were Skopje, Bitola, Shtip, and Vranje provinces. These four provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926, and they held three championships. 

In 1929, these four provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy (Banovina) for 11 times. During World War II, the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After World War II, the very same championship was transformed into a Republic Football League; just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic, and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. 

The bottom line is since the Federation of six Republics split in the 90s, the Macedonian Republic League was transformed into the Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. 

It's a pity that there is a lot of politics and territorial pretensions, lots of denial of the existence of Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation, by the Serbian side. The Serbian official policy is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character, and they are stealing all the history including the history of sports, in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was a Yugoslav nation (Serb) and only Yugoslav Football league (Serb League) denying the Federal League, second Federal League, and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. 

For FC Vardar at this point of view, considering that Macedonia is not in the Federation for more than 20 years, and it won't be in the future, the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League, and if you want to put additional trophies won in the Federation, the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. 

Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of time next to it, instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation doesn't exist anymore and doesn't represent any country nor nation. 

About the cup, you should write down the real proper name as it was called, Marshals Cup, also followed by the Macedonian flag from that period of time; you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East, clubs from Serbia, Macedonia, and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodinship.",0,0,0,0

"Your inquiry touches on complex historical and genetic topics regarding the ancestry of populations in the Levant and their relations to African ancestry, particularly Sub-Saharan ancestry. Let's break this down:  

1. **Historical Migration**: Ancient human migrations out of Africa primarily moved along the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula. It's believed that populations that settled in the areas that are now part of the modern Levant may not have carried significant levels of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, especially as populations adapted to their environments and mixed with different groups over centuries.  
2. **Genetic Diversity**: Genetic studies show that while there are some shared ancestry markers among populations in the region, the modern populations of the Levant (including Jews) have largely been shaped by historical migrations, conquests, and a series of demographic shifts, including the Roman exile, the Islamic conquests, and later movements of people, which influenced their genetic makeup.  
3. **Current Understanding**: It’s important to note that modern populations often reflect a mosaic of ancient ancestry, which doesn't always correlate straightforwardly with geographic proximity. The genetic contributions can differ significantly even among neighboring populations due to historical events and migration patterns.  

Thus, the relatively low levels of Sub-Saharan ancestry in modern Levantine populations, including Jews, can be explained through a combination of genetic drift, selective migration, and historical demographic changes, which led to a unique genetic profile in the region distinct from that of Sub-Saharan populations.",0,0,0,0

"Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of ""anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone.

"Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say ""I am copy 1"" and copy 2 will say ""I am copy 2"".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).",0,0,0,0

"Yes you got it - the Govt lied.  See the talk page for CSELR (OK, I'm lazy and not typing current page name!).  They provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from.  I have provided the link to the index of papers produced (mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw) so you can confirm that the Business case was never provided.  There are no source documents for any figure contained in the Business Case Summary.  Some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post-TfNSW publications (such as with the Capacity claimed by GB on the MR for the Modification Approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are 50% lower.).

I am one of 8 community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about.  That is why I have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language.  The minutes for the Community Rep meeting with TfNSW are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions.  The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.  I have since discovered that 4 of the community reps are current employees of the State Govt and 1 is a past (self-proclaimed) senior executive of TfNSW.  So not only do they not tell the truth - they have also stacked the Community Reference Group.

Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't.

"Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people

This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative. This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it. The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin. The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.

The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too? Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.

And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood? You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them. That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.

Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army. Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill. This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality."""" What's the association between the two?

Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here. I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes. I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.

"""==Street Gang== Mr. Davis, Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be ""complete"".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it. You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me. On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, ""They did all that for me!""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.

"Jung And Einstein 

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",0,0,0,0
"Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first ""main line"" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.",0,0,0,0

"Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the ""firearm experts"" that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.  

M-W Dictionary:  When I say ""the dictionary"" clearly I'm referring to ""the dictionary"" I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a ""cognitive miser"" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on ""the controversy"" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  

Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to ""cartridge clips"" as ""magazines"".  The ""experts"" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to ""magazines"" as ""clips"".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.

What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.

This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.

Therefore, both dates can be correct depending on how one interprets the start of the conflict (i.e., the initiation of airstrikes versus the commencement of ground invasion). It's not uncommon for different sources to highlight varying details, so it's essential to clarify what context each date serves in historical narratives.

Spirit of St. Louis M. MoRsE, there is a newbie editor that has insisted that the flight of the Spirit of St. Louis was the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic and has constantly reverted the article to eliminate the word ""solo"". He has not responded to the discussion page or to the note left on his ""talk"" page. These are his only contributions to Wiki articles and he continues to make spurious claims, see: He will not stop the reverting although he has been politely informed that constant reversions without explanation on the discussion page is not considered appropriate. Asking for help here. Thanks  . I put the article on my watch list and I'll keep an eye on it. The ""solo"" thing is significant.

which it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.
I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was ""to achieve the productivity that was possible"" would be completely superfluous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.
Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?

"None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally ""no one"". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to ""no one"". It is impossible to say ""no one are dinosaurs"". It has to be ""no one is a dinosaur"". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding ""none"" to ""no one"" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that ""none"" is a synonym for ""nothing"". I personally try to avoid expressions such as ""None of the increase"" and would be inclined to write ""No part of the increase""...",0,0,0,0

"This section of the article on John Stark could be improved for clarity regarding the details of David Stinson.

To add clarity, it would be helpful to include a brief explanation of who David Stinson was in relation to John Stark. For instance, you could mention whether he was a friend, family member, or fellow trapper accompanying Stark during the hunting trip. Additionally, a sentence that explains the scenario of Stinson's death—perhaps mentioning the circumstances of the attack or his role within the group—would provide necessary context. If sufficient information cannot be confirmed about David Stinson, it might be prudent to either specify that information is lacking or refine the paragraph to focus on Stark and Eastman without introducing unclear references.",0,0,0,0

"The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle? Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0,0,0,0

    I appreciate your comments and I agreed with most of them.  I realized after you mentioned it that I needed to change the wording of one of the sentences under the Career heading.

However, in regards to creating a hyperlink for Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever - they are graduate students working with Geoffrey Hinton and do not have Wikipedia pages written on them, so I can't make any links for them.  As for the picture of the Hinton, Wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless I had explicit consent from the owner of the photo.  I had contacted Hinton previously to get some information from him personally, but I got the sense that I was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses, so I decided not to pursue him for the picture.

"Deletion of AV News page

Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.

Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.

Here is the content:

The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.

History

The AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.com

The paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.

Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.

The format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.

I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.

"Water rights and their management have been a contentious issue among the Klamath Tribes, particularly considering the historical context of treaties and water resource allocation in the Klamath Basin. The Klamath River Basin, situated in southern Oregon and northern California, has been the focal point of disputes between tribal nations, agricultural stakeholders, environmental advocates, and governmental entities. 

Historically, the Klamath Tribes have relied on the river's water for their sustenance, cultural practices, and traditional fishing rights. However, over the years, competing demands for water use—particularly from agricultural interests—have led to significant tensions. According to reports from Indian Country Today, these conflicts are exacerbated by issues related to drought, climate change, and legal battles over water rights. 

In recent years, the Klamath Tribes have sought to reclaim their water rights and restore the river ecosystem, which has been adversely affected by water management practices. This endeavor includes efforts to ensure sustainable fish populations, such as salmon, which are integral to the tribes' cultural identity and economic livelihood. News from Indian Country provides in-depth coverage of the ongoing negotiations and policy developments that affect the water management framework in the Klamath region. 

Furthermore, the discussion surrounding blood quantum and tribal membership has gained traction within Indigenous communities. As noted, many Native American tribes, including the Klamath, adhere to blood quantum requirements for enrollment. This concept—defining membership based on the percentage of Native ancestry—can have profound implications for identity, rights, and resources within tribal structures. Efforts to modify or eliminate blood quantum criteria are often met with significant debate, balancing the desire for inclusivity against the preservation of cultural heritage and sovereignty. 

For further information and to understand the complexities of these issues, resources such as Indian County Today and News from Indian Country offer a plethora of articles detailing the current issues facing the Klamath Tribes, including ongoing disputes, legislative developments, and community-led initiatives.",0,0,0,0

I can see where using a polished and AR coated rod would be beneficial in such a cavity, coupling more light than difussing it through the surface of the rod. I know from sad experience that keeping the light diffused either way is almost a necessity, to keep the rod from cracking. -{ I believe I also read that on the Kentek website, and in one of the most accurate sources I've found on lasers, Principles of Lasers by Oratio Svelto, although the book is a little difficult to follow as 80% of it is written in math.

Anyhow, thanks again for all of your assistance -D",0,0,0,0

"""Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), \""Holocaust\"" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust is for good reasons I need not rehearse here generally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitz racism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, \""Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism.\"" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victims it is the concept of the holocaust as a racist, modern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

Hi there.  You may have noticed that I've been adding to the excellent article you created here - a few extra refs and some photographs, plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer.  (Oh, and I renamed it too!) Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment?  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status - I haven't done this before, but it seems to comply with the criteria (or to be nearly there, anyway).  What do you think?

Anyway, I've had a go and fixing things and I think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that I've missed, particularly points 1, 5 and 7.  Then perhaps it'll get its GA badge!

"Seems like implying that someone who has different policies is opposed to BSA is a corollary to the principle shoved at me when I tried to include proportionality numbers. Here's the quote: Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this: ""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."" This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most Americans don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were ""undecided"", not ""opposed to Bush"". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say ""60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

"UFC AFDs Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.    Jake Bostwick I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom.  Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article.  Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.  I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

"Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the ""data of consciousness"" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. I'm quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any Jesuit schools would consider his work ""notable"".

"Thanks for your detailed response. It sounds like you're looking for clarification on the fair use guidelines as they pertain to the stamp image. While I understand your point about the image’s significance in illustrating the series, it's important to note that fair use not only considers the contribution of the image but also the availability of alternatives. If an alternative illustration could serve a similar purpose without significantly altering the discussion, that might be a preferred approach. 

Regarding the criteria, indeed, guidelines can be subjective and open to interpretation. The essence of the guidelines is to ensure that all usage aligns with the overall spirit of promoting knowledge while being considerate of copyright issues. If the stamp image is deemed critical to understanding the context or significance of the series, it would be helpful to present a compelling argument that highlights its unique contribution beyond mere illustration. 

Feel free to provide examples or further reasoning that supports your position, as community insight can often aid in making more informed decisions regarding image use. Looking forward to your thoughts!

"as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib)  (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)  So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too?  Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself:  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh)  Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim.  And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it.  I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future?  Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action.  Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)  You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.   In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""".  And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling.

"Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion.",0,0,0,0

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.

"Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...

Curious...
  
""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?",0,0,0,0

"There is some historical context to the connection between Southern Methodist University (SMU) and Vanderbilt University regarding their affiliations with the Methodist Church. In the late 19th century, Vanderbilt University experienced tensions with the Methodist Church, which led to its disaffiliation from the denomination. Around the same time, in 1911, SMU was founded in Dallas, Texas, with strong ties to the Methodist Church. SMU was indeed seen by some as an alternative for Methodists seeking higher education after Vanderbilt's split from the church. However, it is important to note that while SMU may have served as a new opportunity for Methodists after Vanderbilt's disaffiliation, it was not explicitly established as a direct replacement for Vanderbilt, but rather as an independent institution that embraced Methodist values. The founding of SMU aimed to fulfill the educational needs of Methodists in the Southwestern United States, which were not being fully met by other institutions at the time.",0,0,0,0

"Roazir; Fars is the Arabic version of Pars, the Iranian name when translated to English is “the Gulf of Pars” and the English name “Persian Gulf” means exactly the same thing, Interestingly enough most Gulfs in the world are called like the Iranian name for e.g. Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Carpentaria, Gulf of the Farallones, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Guinea, etc, etc, so the correct name for the Persian Gulf should have been “the Gulf Of Pars” just as the Iranian name is! 

As for the Azarbaijan, as both versions already exist on the Wiki and we are not inventing a new name, I insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. The whole population of Rep Azerbaijan is less than 10% of the population of Iran (let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word  Azarbaijan like Iranians do) so why a vast majority should follow a small minority?

"Hi there! It's great to see your enthusiasm for the project and how you've made substantial progress already. Your template idea for the article's talk pages sounds like a productive move to foster communication among members. Translating articles using automatic translators could be a great way to enhance accessibility, but it will be essential to have discussions around the quality of translations and potential errors that might arise from such practices. 

Regarding the topic navigation between gay literature and LGBT literature, it's wonderful that you're already engaging in thoughtful debates about the direction of your project. Consider also gathering insights from broader audiences to see how they define their interests—it's a timely inquiry. 

You're correct in viewing a Wiki Project as an assembly of interested individuals with a shared goal. Initiating discussions on what constitutes a Wiki Project and how each member can contribute efficiently will likely clear up any ambiguity. Keeping the momentum should not solely rest on you; fostering active participation from all group members will help distribute responsibilities and encourage a sense of community.

"The image of the ""Dvcode giftset box"" may be utilized under the doctrine of fair use for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, the use of this image serves a transformative purpose by providing insight into the product's aesthetics and packaging, which can facilitate discussions around consumer goods and the beauty industry. The image is not used for commercial gain, but rather for educational or illustrative purposes.

1. **Purpose and Character of Use**: The primary aim of using the image is to inform and educate consumers about the Dvcode giftset. By including the image in a review or blog post, it demonstrates the product and enhances the reader's understanding. This educational intent leans towards non-commercial use, reinforcing the fair use argument.

2. **Nature of the Work**: The Dvcode giftset box is a commercial product, which typically allows for a greater leeway in its reproduction for educational and non-commercial purposes. However, as it relates to consumer information and personal reviews, the character aligns well with fair use. 

3. **Amount and Substantiality**: The image reveals only the outer packaging of the gift set, a limited portion of the product overall. This use of a single image minimizes the amount taken from the original work, thereby meeting fair use criteria.

4. **Effect on Market Value**: Using this image does not negatively impact the market for the Dvcode giftset box. On the contrary, it may serve to promote the product by generating interest among potential consumers, which would be beneficial for the creator's market. 

In conclusion, the use of the image of the Dvcode giftset box falls under fair use due to its transformative educational purpose, limited scope, and non-commercial nature. It supports consumer understanding without harming the financial interests of the original creator.",0,0,0,0

There are two different issues. The . While that doesn't mean they can never be cited, it is unlikely to go without discussion. Your main problem still seems to be that this is an encyclopedia, while your article starts with a concrete question about the dineutron and the Isospin and then drifts away into more general considerations.

"Naji al-Ali

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is ""Sulaiman al-Shaikh - ""The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying ""I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

"North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled ""Korea's Northern Border Reigion"" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. 

On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' 
Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)

 Support for the most common name. Searches for ""Chonji"" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name ""Chonji"" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because ""Tianchi"" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.    Comment''': The issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn't be ignored. Thus perhaps Tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a Tianchi (disambiguation) page. Either one is a reasonable alterna",0,0,0,0

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, ""Vṛndāvana-bhajana."" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.

Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

"Disruptive Activity

Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to vandalize Wikipedia, as you did at Paracetamol, you may be blocked from editing.    🍌 (email)

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.  

I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise.

"You resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile Binksternet.
For starters, dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009, while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1, he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo, to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. As i'm saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed, no decision was made and the discussion ended. Paulh, or you did not say anything. If he wanted the photo then, why didn't he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? I would've left it at that then, but instead he and other editors remained silent. I didn't restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest, or didn't have the time.

Furthermore, I did not ""slip in"" as you disgustingly, dishonestly, facetiously say. I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January. Again, no one did anything for months. You and Paulh cannot claim you didn't see the change, because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.

Again, Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change, or continue the discussion where it had left off. Once again, he instead changed the photo, got a ""consensus"" from Binksternet. The IP editor liked the photo, but, quoting the editor again:

""Any of the photos in that section (""FinancialNorth.jpg""; ""Montgomerystreetsf.jpg""; ""Federal Reserve Band (San Francisco).jpg"") except #2 (SanFranciscoEmbarcadero.jpg) would be fine as a replacement, and even the cropped version of #2 is better than the one currently there now. Thoughts?64.81.57.93 (talk)""

""I'm going to replace it with ""FinancialNorth.jpg"" and see what happens.""

The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it, or I or other editors could respond.

Binksternet's abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. Despite my reverts, I at least agreed to having a discussion and a ""photo choosing contest"" as it were. Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. I don't see Binksternet asking the IP editor in question or other editors to the SF article including Optigan13 have their say either in this. He is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus, something that at least Paulh did earlier. Only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me",0,0,0,0

"(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern ""Slavic"" and ""Dalmatian"" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0,0,0,0

"YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most ""contructive"" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so.

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.",0,0,0,0

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as ""Germany"" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given.

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). ""West Germany"" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The ""enlarged"" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as ""Germany"") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.",0,0,0,0

"I appreciate your insight on the topic. It seems the statements in bold could compromise the neutrality of the article for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the assertion that 'Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last Prophet' presents a viewpoint that may not encompass the diversity of beliefs surrounding prophetic tradition and spiritual authority among different religions, and could be seen as a definitive statement rather than an acknowledgment of belief. 

Secondly, the idea that ‘there will be no guidance from God’ after Muhammad is a theological position that reflects Islamic doctrine but can be viewed as exclusive to followers of Islam. Other faiths might contest this claim, which should be considered in a neutral point of view (NPOV). 

As for the mention of Mani, presenting that as a belief without counterbalancing it with a broader context may further lean the article toward one perspective, neglecting an inclusive discussion of other belief systems. You mentioned usedbook's version. It might be important to encourage checking for multiple sources or contrasting viewpoints to support a more neutral and balanced representation of the beliefs in question. Using well-cited references enhances credibility and aligns with the NPOV guideline, helping to validate claims made in the text rather than relying solely on assertions.",0,0,0,0

"The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it. Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out. But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the ""purple patch that began with...,"" etc. This seems clear to me.

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is ""thankfully relatively rare"", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be ""thankfully relatively rare"". Why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach, and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word ""molesting"", instead of forcing onto all BLP articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? (and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).

And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos' without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks? Even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. A systemic failure perhaps?

And finally, as an admin, perhaps you can tell me why the IP user is not now blocked, irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. Incidentally, the now famous bad account on Ted Kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a BLP violation on an unrelated article. Another systemic failure?

"Thanks for the feedback. There seems to be a common misunderstanding about line breaks after section headers. The style guideline you're referring to is indeed based on the Manual of Style (MOS) for Wikipedia. The guideline aims to maintain a consistent and clean appearance in the articles; having an extra line break can make the text look disjointed and harder to read. 

When using AWB, it often prompts you to revert these line breaks to adhere to the best practices outlined in the MOS, which is why you may see it as part of the automated editing process. Removing these breaks becomes a way to streamline formatting across edits, ensuring uniformity. 

For those who might frequently add line breaks, it's always a good idea to review the MOS to align with best practices. This can help enhance readability and make collaborative editing more efficient. If after studying the guidelines you find them unnecessary for your contributions, it may also be useful to engage in community discussion, as standards can be modified through consensus.

"reverting to last known edit by me. The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page.

Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages.

As the Zogby poll shows, 42% of America believes the government is covering up 9/11 and 45% want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.

For now on, any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol.

"As far as presenting sources are concerned, the book The life and exploits of Alexander the Great sites much more sources in detail than source, which I think refers to some sources already referred by others. As such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the Author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. Its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps, perhaps not. As far as the Author is concerned, in my understanding, he himself suggested that the story of Alexander that originated from Egypt should be considered more authentic than others ( reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history, whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat; to these countries, then, we must not look for the original Alexander story. Similarly, we must not look to the states of Greece for it, because at the death of Alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of Macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. One country only could be the birthplace of the Alexander story, and that country was Egypt..). I am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the Alexander story from Egypt as authentic (which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources, especially ones from Greece that perhaps dominate current understanding). This according to me, forms one of the essence of the Alexander story, and I hope someone clarifies which story is the Egypt story in the said book which I myself is unsure for I don't have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off Egypt origins. At the most I can only hope that someone will research into the Alexander story from Egypt, and not his fanboy fantasies from Greece, to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. Then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.",0,0,0,0

The 'Deutschen' don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into 'Assyrian' by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also 'Siryon' or 'Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)', which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites. Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history.

"Deletion discussion about Shiv Ram Park
Hello, Mj.foru, and thanks for contributing to Wikipedia! 

I wanted to let you know that some editors are discussing at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shiv Ram Park  whether the article Shiv Ram Park should be in Wikipedia. I encourage you to comment there if you think the article should be kept in the encyclopedia. 

The deletion discussion doesn't mean you did something wrong. In fact, other editors may have useful suggestions on how you can continue editing and improving Shiv Ram Park, which I encourage you to do. If you have any questions, feel free to ask at the Help Desk.

"no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

"great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called ""post-industrial"" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as ""noise music"".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now.

"There are actually four Lord Fairfaxes mentioned in this article. You have Martin's grandfather (5th Lord Fairfax), his uncle (6th Lord Fairfax), his other uncle (7th Lord Fairfax), and cousin (8th Lord Fairfax). Since the majority of this article deals with his uncle, the 6th Lord Fairfax, I've tried to disambiguate as best I can. In the prose, I've stated: ""Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719."" The 6th Lord Fairfax was known as ""Lord Fairfax,"" so I've tried to start this out in the prose so that the reader will know it refers to the 6th Lord Fairfax.

"""November 2007 (UTC) It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple: According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words: - God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision. - God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision! The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules. Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this ""Discussion"" introduces my ""discovery"" (a child would do it). It says: - God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise."""" But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis. Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I! The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing. Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

"I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is ""one step removed"" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred,
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who
who do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins,
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

"Is this a press release? ==

With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname ""Nuclear Wintour"".

I'm sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims. Who has widely praised her? Who says she is important? And the word reportedly, reportedly by whom? Where is a source for her nickname? Is her pageboy bob really trademarked?

Also the following-She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era.

So she was a newspaper consultant? I find it hard to believe that her Father,a grown man, would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone. Where are sources for this? I guess I will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow. If anyone wants to help please help me. I have only read 2 paragraphs on this Wikipedia page about Anna Wintour, so I am wondering what else needs to be fixed. I will read more tomorrow.98.87.94.167

He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious.

As the Wikipedia page says: ""...You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all"" Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975.

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

"So his summaries weren't ""AS"" antagonistic.  So whichever person is a bit more antagonistic gets the warning.  Good to know.  On to your second claim: I still don't understand how *I* have a ""pattern of edit warring,"" but Olyeller doesn't when: (1) I added a completely valid and relevant and referenced sentence; and (2) OlYeller repeatedly removed it for NO VALID REASON; and (3) Olyeller falsely claimed in his summary that the issue was presented in the talk page.  So it's odd that falsifying summaries isn't considered a form of antagonism and/or worthy of a warning. The only reason OlYeller removed it is because he has a really big anti-Carbonator grudge.

Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts? You know if we wrote that The Urantia Book is an epochal revelation containing religio-scientific cosmology... there would then start more POV debating. 00:34, 16",0,0,0,0

"Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff.

The O in ""opossum"" is spelled but not pronounced. It is a silent letter, just like the H in the word ""honest."" The articles ""a"" and ""an"" are correctly based on the first pronounced letter, not simply the first letter.

So, you have the phrase ""an honest man"" not ""a honest man,"" even though H is a consonant. Likewise, the phrase should be ""a opossum"" not ""an opossum,"" again based on the first pronounced letter.

Therefore, I will go through the Article changing ""an opossum"" to ""a opossum."" The O in ""opossum"" is no different from the H in ""honest.""",0,0,0,0

Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse. Otherwise, keep finding more stories and information about UNC lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together.

Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so ""bad.""  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.  So go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against JRB, but provide the arguments and thinking FOR JRB also.

"Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ""the history of science"" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR",0,0,0,0

"Cleanest City - It is surprising that Trivandrum is 73 out of 250. But, that surely is not a good ranking. Like Aarem suggested, being in the Top 10 deserves to be called 'one of the cleanest'. Also, cleanliness is not just about 'clean', it is about pollution, waste treatment etc. I suggest that 'one of the cleanest' should be removed.
Best Airport- I am not sure what this means. This tag was given well before the new Terminal was inaugurated. I cannot understand how one could rate the old TRV terminals as one of the best! If looks is the yardstick here,most of the airports have modern terminals now and we should wait for a ranking of all the new terminals. Also, the statement does not say on what grounds it is the best airport - in terms of - revenue, traffic, profits, passenger traffic, facilities? If you would like to retain it, please be more specific and of course have the references ready.
Cheapest and Closest option - I would suggest rephrasing this to ""one of the closest options to Maldives and Sri Lanka and the only direct option to Maldives.

"Senior descendant of Victoria & Albert? 

Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.",0,0,0,0

"The removed paragraph Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic I have removed this paragraph, not because I would necessarily disagree, but because this is a speculative formulation (a ""POV"" in wikipedia terminology) not suitable for an encyclopaedia.

"Response to third opinion request:Hi, I'm here to give your third opinion.  I think it's important to keep in mind that this article is titled ""Common English usage misconceptions"".  It's not ""Common English mistakes according to professional typography standards"".  It is clear - to me at least - that the hypen is often misused.  There's no dash key on my keyboard.  I know how to make a dash, however, —.  But I do web dev and work for a printing company. And I just started a sentence with ""but"", and this one with ""and"".  I know all these things are wrong - but they are convenient - and I'm writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page.  So, in my mind, the question is whether this is a misconception, or just ignorance.  I believe that to properly call something a misconception, it must be believed to be a rule, when in fact such a rule is not correct.  I've never heard anyone say, ""just use hyphens for everything"".  It has only become the default, because we have no dash keys.

"I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, ""In Cold Blood"", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.",0,0,0,0

24 X 7 Water Supply By Using Existing Resources Sidramappa Shivashanksr Dharane dr.dr.sidramappa@gmail.com mob-09890283390 24 x 7 water supply is possible by using existing resources. The small supply of water in the bore wells can be used effectively. The existing pumps can be used with one regulator to adjust the capacity of pump/speed as per the supply of water in the bore wells which will maintain the continuity of flow; thereby the main principle of getting maximum water from the bore can be achieved i. e. Q outlet ≤ Q inlet. All the bore wells which are not in use because of its small supply of water will also start to function as per their capacities of inlet discharge.,0,0,0,0

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

"There are many inaccurate statements being posted here. Far too many, i don't have time to correct all of them. The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact. BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism. If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF (Unite against Freedom), who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. Is that democratic?

"To promote a pawn to a knight in international chess, you need to move your pawn to the eighth rank of the board (the last row for the player with the pawn). When a pawn reaches this rank, you can replace it with any piece of the same color, and the most common choices are a queen, rook, or bishop. However, you can also choose to promote it to a knight if you prefer. This can be particularly strategic in certain situations, such as delivering check or checkmate. Once the pawn is on the eighth rank, simply declare your promotion to a knight and place the knight on that square.

"The author of LotR clearly intended it to be a single book, and it was sold as one concurrently with the three-volume editions as soon as it became popular enough to be economically feasible. The utilitarian separation of the book into three volumes does not seem to me to be sufficient reason to declare it to be three separate books. This is in stark contrast with Rowling's books, which have been published sequentially, separated by years in between them, and are considered by everyone (including the author and publisher) to be separate books entirely. I agree that the individual books deserve a place on this list inasmuch as they merit one, and that the series as a whole belongs on the series page. I hope we can put this matter to rest now.

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes.

"The books of Maccabees and the Gospels refer to the land (and nation) as ""Israel"" throughout this period and the term is still used in Acts.

As far as I know it has been stated that several ""universes"" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those ""universes"" or ""worlds"" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not ""accepted"" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

""""mere editors"""" really have little recourse in this. filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past. it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor. filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse. admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence. a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings. in an ideal world i think you are right people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen. i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies. we need to define what something like """"disruption"""" is. when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included. that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the """"trust admins to do what is right"""". it has failed.",0,0,0,0
"Fair use rationale for Image:A_to_Z_(Butterfinger).jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:A_to_Z_(Butterfinger).jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ""my contributions"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ""Image"" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also ""the"" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German ""von"" or ""zu"" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph's title as Fürst, which wouldn't make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04",0,0,0,0

Anti-dictatorial is not a single classification - it should not even be a classification, in my opinion.

Deflation is much maligned by Federal Reserve through its control of the economic profession. The US did much better economically in the 1800's under deflation than after 1913 and the Fed's inflation. The reason that the Fed pushes inflation is that it provides a shelter from criticism of its theft of property through the wealth transfer effect of inflation.

"Speedy deletion of Vanilla (French band) A tag has been placed on Vanilla (French band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

This simple rule should apply: If the term ""mercenary"" would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an African government, the term ""mercenary"" should be used to describe the job or person working for a non-African government.

"Recap

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows:

""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) ""

As for ""The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm...""
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance. Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by at that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are ""A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"" and ""An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read ""The algorithm used for this purpose..."" to ""One algorithm used for this purpose..."" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be ""...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves.

As for ""...references not supporting the notability of the subject""
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like ""Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for ""The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... "" 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0,0,0,0

"Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is ""Mary Lou""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  ",0,0,0,0

The Nazis indeed made some huge mistakes: the anti-Slavic agenda was what ruined them. But despite this, these days, neo-Nazis generally include people from pretty much every European ethnic group, including Southern Europeans and Slavic people.

"Response to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann

I reverted your edit because you give partial information, not because of the wording I prefer. What parts do not make sense? The ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? Stop saying it is bad English, if it was just that you'd fix it without removing information.

""Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation"" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:

1- It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear.
 
2- Several unfair critics were made to the methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police. 
Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:

3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as ""forging evidence"": ""He [Gonçalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being."" 

4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine). In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).  
It seems that the British methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:

5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking  
 
6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing:  

5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. ""The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her"" Something made them change their minds?

The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has. 
I hope it was clearly written and the ""parts of it do not make sense"" start to make sense.
I am going to revert the edit, you are welcome to correct any ""bad English"", not the information.

"Whole Article Needs to be Rewritten

I believe this whole article needs to be rewritten from top to bottom. It jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby not showing in a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed. There is a lot of text devoted to the work of Keith Johnstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is nowhere near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the role of IO and The Second City).

The article, in its present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process? Who selects the person to take the first stab at it? I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite. He has a master’s degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film ""David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"").

"The definition for Fundamental Attribution Error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. I would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. (i.e., “situational factors such as luck,) Compared to the Fundamental Attribution Error definition that was provided in quotes, the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow, though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like I mentioned above. Maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words (i.e., change “social perceiver” -> “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. Instead of a “in the real world” I would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”. Using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well, followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”.

"Cultural sources of monosodium glutamate (MSG) usage in various cuisines:

1. **Asian Cuisines:**  
   - **Chinese:** MSG is widely used to enhance the umami flavor in soups, stir-fries, and sauces.  
   - **Taiwanese:** Similar usage as in mainland China, with MSG enhancing flavors in various dishes.  
   - **Vietnamese:** Common in pho and many other traditional dishes for depth of flavor.  
   - **Japanese:** Often used in ramen broths and varied sauces.
   - **Korean:** Utilized in kimchi preparation and various stews like jjigae.  

2. **Southeast Asian Cuisines:**  
   - **Thai:** While some authentic Thai recipes avoid it, many restaurants use MSG in curries and stir-fries for flavor enhancement.
   - **Indonesian:** MSG is added to a variety of dishes like fried rice and stews.
   - **Filipino:** Common in adobo and many street foods.

3. **Latin American Cuisines:**  
   - **Mexican:** Not traditionally used in cooking but may be found in processed food and some restaurants.
   - **Caribbean:** Can be used, often in packaged seasonings or soup bases.

4. **American Cuisine:**  
   - **Fast Food:** Widely used in fast-food items for flavor enhancement.
   - **Home Cooking:** Generally avoided in traditional American home cooking, though some packaged foods may contain MSG.

5. **European Cuisines:**  
   - **Italian:** Traditionally, authentic Italian cuisine does not use MSG; flavor is enhanced through fresh herbs and ingredients.  
   - **French:** Similar to Italian, MSG is generally avoided; flavors are developed through technique and quality ingredients.
   - **Eastern European:** Typically, MSG is not a common practice; reliance on natural flavors from ingredients used.

6. **Middle Eastern Cuisines:**  
   - Generally, MSG is not a common aspect of authentic Middle Eastern cooking; attention is usually on the freshness of spices and herbs.

### Conclusion:
The use of MSG varies significantly among different cultures. While it is prevalent in many Asian cuisines, its application in Latin American and European cuisines is less consistent. As culinary trends evolve, so too does the stance on MSG in cooking and flavor enhancement.",0,0,0,0

"I've come across variations on draughts, as I've always called it - we had a compendium of games that came in a cube - it had six sides on it, one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.

With draughts, apart from the traditional version, there were the following variations:

Dammspiel - that's what the manual called it - I think it's also called Damenspiel - you set them up a bit like chess, but they were placed one square forward (hard to explain) - the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts - diagonally, one square - I think the kings could move multiple squares - a bit like the ""Flying Kings"" rule people have mentioned - except that you stop short of capturing - my memory is hazy on the issue.

Turkish Checkers - similar set-tup to Dammspiel/Damenspiel - it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces, the set-up being on the same squares you'd use for draughts - pieces move one square forwards, and, if I remember rigtly, capture diagonally, like standard draughts - the kings, I believe, move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line - again, my memory is hazy regarding the rules.

One game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names - Arrow Draughts, Dagger Draughts or Kings.

Played similar to standard draughts - you play it corner-to-corner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger - you then play it like regular draughts.

"A problem with ""English Patriot Man"" and his sockpuppets 

Hi. Lately I've seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named: ""English Patriot Man"". I see that this man is nearly obsessed with Polish people. He seems to spread his anti-Polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning World War II, nazism in Europe and racism against Poles. He is totally denying the sufferings of the Polish nation. 
Thank you so much for taking care of him, and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. However, now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place, so that his personal data and IP address would be totally different.

This guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about Poles being percieved as ""subhumans"" or ""non-Aryans"" by the nazis. In fact the only ""Aryan-looking"" Poles that were accepted by Nazi Germany at the time, were kidnapped as children and underwent ""Germanisation"", they were like 0.05% of the whole nation. The rest of the Poles were ""insufficient"" to be a part of the nazi-ruled nation, and were treated only slightly better that the Jews.

However before I go any further, may I express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them. I realise (and no doubt others will too) that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at U of T. And most importantly, I realise that we did as future scholars was wrong. I know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of Wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. Though I can understand where you are coming from, I do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long-run. I see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides, but as a first year student I have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. I am asking as both an avid reader of Wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge, please do not black-out our privaleges to use and edit articles. Let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits Wikipedia and my school.  Looking to make this a better place, CivCodex  Thanks. We have no issues with people who are interested in Wikipedia coming to edit Wikipedia.

Comments please. °Talk  I think the central dillema is this: a student could make a poor-quality contribution that harms Wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. If the grading rubric was accurate, a student would receive 0 or negative credit. My personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment, increase their Wikipedia knowedge, and improve the grading rubrics themselves. I'm fairly proud of Education Program:Saint Louis University/Signal Transduction (SP13), which I helped write. You might want to ask   There should also be some sort of policy re: how the community reacts to profs and students. The active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies, in the first place; and we are often more unkind than necessary, in the second.

"As for the change in ""Romanian"" to ""Reich"", yes it is difficult to work out what Caldwell is referring to. It seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in W.Germany (not Polesti). RAF Bomber Command used an attack by the 8AF to attack this target. The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your ""give me a quote"" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the ""oil"" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med. Theatre). So your generalisation of a ""quote"", if this indeed is what it is, makes the Bulk of the German fighter force concentrated in Romania false.",0,0,0,0

"I think noone is saying with ""failed state"", that there are no parts of the state where organization has resulted in quite a livable situation. But that seems to be not due to, but sometimes (in the case of Somaliland) despite the fact that there is no permanent central government who has a legitimate monopoly on power. The fact that there are promising things happening in Somalia outside the central government is a good thing, but that only stresses that the state as such at this moment can be characterized a failed state.

"Narciso Yepes

Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166  

Your discussion at Narciso Yepes

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. ""The Ten-String Guitar"" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!",0,0,0,0

"Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete ""when in doubt don't delete"" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

"I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name ""anonymous"" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as ""logic"". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India.

"Free Software / Open Source

In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase ""free and open source"". 
The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection. If the developers use ""free software"" it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. If the developers of a certain program use only ""open source"" and the license of the program is indeed an open source license (Excluding the GNU GPL. Its text explicitly uses the term ""free software"") then it's ok to use that description.

The purpose is that the reader should not understand the word ""free"" to mean ""gratis"" in this case. Unfortunately just using ""free"" alone makes it more likely that people will understand ""gratis"".

If you software into that phrase ""free and open source"" something like ""open source and free software"" it would be better.",0,0,0,0

I am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious, and I am asking you kindly to back off, as I am starting to get annoyed.

My change to ""Lacon, IL"" was sourced via Grazulis, and you obviously reverted because you saw my username, and didn't even check or research the validity of my edit. I would bet money that if any other user made that edit, you wouldn't have reverted it. If you have this idea that I make willy-nilly edits with no basis, then you are mistaken.

It is fascinating; This comment clearly comes from an established editor. I must say I find it disappointing to know that there is at least one editor on Wikipedia who is so cowardly they cannot bring themselves to be linked to their comments. What are they afraid of I wonder? One would think that as they are too embarrassed to be linked to this post, then it speaks far more about them, than about Majorly.    Chat  
Maybe the editor in question is cowardly because they are privy the most private of communications, and would like to continue to be. Knowing Majorly, he'll probably go sulk on his blog about this - hey Majorly, I have some Obie Trice for you to listen to. Bye for now, 203.22.204.77

Add to that that northerners were almost 100 % the ship owners and ship captains that brought all slaves over to the US South ; and add to that , that black kings, chiefs were the ones who sold into slavery, all the slaves that were in the US South... and so on and on the story is one of fundamental distortion... And of the % of whites in South who owned slaves, they have all been dead 150 years... further add to the fact that for 100 % of white Southerners, the flag has always represented Valor in battle of the 600,000 approximately white southerners who died in the war... Add to that the war began due to invasion by North and the 100 % felt view of white southerners that states rights then was the main issue and to a very small view , slavery way below that esp as those 99 % of confederate soldiers and their families did not own and had never owned slaves....

"Some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation). But I'm not sure the term ""political cult"" is appropriate in reference to North Korea, since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that don't wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secret-police power of a post-revolutionary state.Dking (Dennis King), 2 Sept 2006",0,0,0,0

"Shocked! I am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an EB account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information. That opinion took a nosedive today when I came across this 'article' in Wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection. 

If I want to find out about Bose headphones (or any other product) I will go to their web site - I don't expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia. One can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader. 

The FACT is I don't care whether this so called article is written from a NPOV or not, whether it's balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not - I DO care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if it's a fact it somehow deserves a place here.

"As a professional dissenter, one may face a variety of consequences, including: 
1. **Professional Isolation**: Colleagues may distance themselves due to discomfort with dissenting opinions, potentially leading to a lack of support. 
2. **Career Advancement**: Opportunities for promotions or raises could diminish, as dissent may be perceived negatively by superiors.
3. **Reputation Impact**: Being seen as a consistent dissenter may tarnish one's professional reputation, affecting future job prospects.
4. **Workplace Conflict**: Expressing dissent can lead to conflict with management or coworkers, creating a hostile work environment.
5. **Burnout and Stress**: Constantly voicing dissent can be mentally exhausting and may contribute to workplace burnout. 
6. **Job Security Risks**: In some cases, dissenters may face termination or disciplinary action, especially if dissent involves criticizing the company or its policies publicly.
7. **Legal Consequences**: Depending on the nature of the dissent and the industry, there could be legal repercussions, particularly if it involves whistleblowing or breaches of confidentiality.
8. **Emotional Toll**: The stress of being a dissenter, especially in a strongly conformist environment, can lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction in one's professional life.",0,0,0,0
"""TigerDirect has always relied very heavily on rebate marketing and this has been true, in the least, for several years, and their failure to honor them has made them as big as they are today.""  That is baloney.  That statement reflects pure bias.  You can go count the number of rebates on TigerDirect.com and you'll find less there than you find on Amazon or Newegg or any of TigerDirect.com's other competitors.  Regarding the attorney general's complaint, you also have to note that in response to the complaint TigerDirect argued that it's not true.  If you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and CE reseller in the country.

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

In my opinion, glossaries, timelines, and year articles may be useful for navigation, but they also have the capability to become complete articles used for purposes other than navigation; I don't see outlines, indexes, and Lists of X topics articles as being able to be more than a navigational aid.

Alongside Clayface, a resurrected one-off concept from 1940 (there are 6 resurrections in total).

In the 1970s, new Batman villains begin to adopt influences from horror and realistic crime fiction (secret agent films), first with Man-Bat (who unlike Batman, is a real human/animal hybrid) and the later with the master criminal Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia, the first villains to learn Batman's identity. (very ok!!!)

The less famous villan, but often equally charismatic Ventriloquist, KGBeast, Black Mask and Killer Croc emerged iduring the 1980s.

More common criminals, such as the Gotham mob leader Carmine Falcone were also added to the villain lineup

The 1990s were notorious for the introduction of the Joker's assistant, Harley Quinn who appeard exclusivley in the cartoon series.

Bane, was the only villain to physically humble Batman. Hush and a new Red Hood are the most famous inductees in the 2000s, due to their connections to Batman's past

Since other p4p boxers have more sections, I don't see the issue with adding more for Vitali. But we can decide that in the future after his next fight. For now, there is only the Chisora fight. Given the slap in the pre-fight conference, spitting in Wladimir's face before the fight and brawling with Haye in the post-conference, I think this is worthy of a headline.

"I actually hadn't even seen the current Equalization filter article when I spoke before, but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article Equalization (audio) that you both have proposed. I could make the issue a little more complicated though: Graphic equalizer (not yet written), Smiley face curve, Parametric equalization, and British EQ all have to do with what I'll call ""Music equalization"" (for lack of a better term). This includes sections 1 and 2 of the current Equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls, loudness control (combine with Smiley face), speaker equalization etc. Oh, I'm certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles, but could as well be topics in one article (except that a few of these already exist separately). The article should mention that ""equalization"" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.

Then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization (or some such term) which WOULD include section 3 of Equalization filter (Telecommunications lines), RIAA equalization, FM pre/de-emphasis as well as equalization of non-audio channels; this is the orginal meaning of ""equalization""). Such equalizers are generally non-adjustable (by a user, at least) and transparent to the end user. So I call it a different subject, even when it IS audio. Anyway, I don't have much time to deal with this nor am I the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems.

However, the edit also suggests an inclination towards minimizing speculative interpretations and terminology often found in science fiction, which may limit the diversity of perspectives presented in the article.

"The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is ""British & Irish Isles"". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, the Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.

Did you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? 

Completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople. 

A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now ""Greek islands"" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated ""Greek"" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.

"For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned. The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems: """"In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg.  The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, ""The Living Legend,"" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis. Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à-la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise. Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a ""rodeo cowboy"" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris ",0,0,0,0

The revert restoring the ""List of Canadian Prime Ministers"" section created a whole section for one link that duplicated one at the top of the ""Qualifications and selection"" section. The revert restoring the ""Salary"" and ""Privileges"" sections split an earlier merge of the two, for no apparent benefit. It also reinstated trivial and unsourced comparisons of the Prime Minister's salary to ""some of Canada's top corporate executives"" (note weasel words). The revert restoring the ""Living former Prime Ministers"" reinstated trivial information better covered at List of Prime Ministers of Canada.

"The importance of Khalifman...and of Anand, Ponomariov, Kazimzhinov and Topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for FIDE...cannot be overstated.   They represent the rule of law  the functioning of the world title cycle  at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property, rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle (as it had been from 1948 onward).  To say that Fischer, Kasparov or Alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of Khalifman's title reign.   One could say that Fischer, Kasparov and Alkehine were stronger than Euwe and Smyslov, too...but that doesn't get us anywhere.   We don't rank US presidents by reputation  we list them all equally, yes?  Khalifman himself  in 1999 in interviews  said that although he was not the strongest player in the world (being 44th by rating)...he was clearly the world champion (having won the title in the open, public cycle run by FIDE).   That stand  that position  is what makes his title reign important.

"Ekantik, do you believe that Sathya Sai Baba can miraculously transform his genitals? I would appreciate an answer.

I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.

Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote ""well sourced"" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not ""well sourced"".

Lord of the Rings was created here (Not the Movie) but the story trilogy was here. England is sort of similar to Australia, only older, more history, more pubs,more people,tiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. I'm doing all right for money and spent some at London's Best Gamesworkshop in Oxford Street. Gamesworkshops are bigger and better in England. I have been to a couple but can't buy much because of space in my ags. Rohan & Saun would love these Gamesworkshops in England. There are Mini Gamesworkshops in Villages smaller than Broadford, and still they are fanstatic. Bigger Gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger Towns and Cities eg Nottingham, London, Mancester, Oxford and many more. Tell Rohan that i went past the Gamesworkshop Headquarters, the Citadel Miniatures Factory and Warhammer World in Nottingham. But Unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was Derbyshire and ran out of time. But I certainly will go there when i come back to England if i have time.

"Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the """"procedure"", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): """"Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of."""" concerning the closure of """"proposal"""". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""""IroK"""") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.
Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the """"IroK"""" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term """"recognition"""" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.

"""September 2013 (UTC) I love how I specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here, and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission. Your 2-line response was the equivalent of 'nana-nana boo-boo,' as far as I am concerned. Let's dissect these 2 lines. 'You don't understand propaganda.' That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. 'You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.' I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, 'base tan'), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not 'a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?'. That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as 'presenting one side of an argument' to 'influence the attitude of the community'? Or, is it that, as you say, I just 'don't understand propaganda'? I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my 'opinion'. 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of 'good business' - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o",0,0,0,0

"Yes, the discrepancy you've noticed between the episode numbers and the original air date indicates that the episodes may have been aired out of order. In many cases, especially with TV series, episodes can be produced and numbered in a certain sequence, but network scheduling or other considerations might lead to a different airing order. This is not uncommon in television history. If you are seeing significant gaps or an apparently random sequence among the episode numbers, it suggests that the series was not aired in the order that the creators intended. This is similar to the original series where episodes were frequently aired out of their intended storyline order, which can affect character development and overall narrative coherence.

"The term 'spy' typically brings to mind clandestine operations and secretive information gathering, which contrasts with the notion of being an accredited diplomat. If this man was officially assigned to the Embassy of the USSR and recognized as a diplomat, it implies that he was operating in an overt capacity, likely with a focus on diplomacy rather than espionage. While intelligence officers can work in a diplomatic setting, the connotation of 'spy' usually doesn't apply in the context of formal diplomatic duties, unless supported by evidence of covert activities. The dual depiction creates ambiguity—are we discussing legitimate diplomatic work or does the implication of spying arise from potential ulterior motives?

"basic income dispute resolution

I don't understand the finding ""futile"", or how to proceed to resolve the issue.

Regarding the [Wikipedia,_bicycles,_and_wagons] reference, its my understanding that I am building a bicycle, that may be slightly off spec, and the editors are ordering the steel melted and shipped to hell, instead of allowing the bicycle to be refined into spec. I point out also that the [basic income] is listed as a priority by four wikigroups, and so it is a pretty important bicycle. Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed. To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups. There is a difference of opinion over whether the bicycle meets specs, but it is a functional bicycle that is more useful than a pile of melted metal shipped far away.",0,0,1,0

It's important to acknowledge both the collective tragedy and individual narratives to honor the memories of those who suffered and resisted.

"""An interesting comment:  ""Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: ""effectively abolished slavery..."" True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the ""involuntary servitude"" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article. So yes it's important to look at historians, but on some topics there's a whole lot of rubbish, particularly w/ slavery issues, so a consensus by historians may never happen, and sadly ideological agendas do exist, and I understand what you blokes mean about good sources. I'd say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important.  15:00, 18 July""",0,0,0,0

Johnny responded ""Okay"" and went upstairs to change his clothers. The mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. After Johnny put on his play clothes, he went out to the backyard.

"The question of the legitimacy of the Union and the role of the Stuarts in the history of the United Kingdom is as complex as it is intriguing. To entertain the idea that Bonnie Prince Charlie did not seek to dissolve the Union is to understand the broader context of the Jacobite cause that he championed. While traditional narratives, often curated by Whig historians, tend to portray the Stuarts as warmongers fixated on restoring an archaic order, what they fail to recognize is that the Jacobites were not merely fighting against the Union but were, in fact, restoring what they viewed as legitimate governance rooted in the historical context of Britain.

It is essential to argue that Bonnie Prince Charlie's aspiration was not to hark back to an old regime but to reestablish a national identity that he believed was being eroded by Hanoverian rule. In that light, an attack on the Union as it existed post-1707 can be construed as an assertion of rightful governance rather than a campaign for an outright dissolution. The Union itself, which was meant to combine Scottish and English legislatures, often placed the interests of the English crown and Parliament over those of Scotland, which was exacerbated by Hanoverian indifference to Scottish culture and law.

Moreover, when we examine the foundations of the UK, we find that they are deeply interwoven with the Stuart dynasty, both politically and culturally. The Union of the Crowns in 1603 under James VI of Scotland (who became James I of England) was a critical moment in British history. It heralded the beginning of a united monarchy that would evolve into what we know today as the United Kingdom. The Stuart dynasty set the stage for parliamentary evolution and the concept of a unified kingdom through a shared Crown.

Whig historians have, for centuries, insisted on depicting the Stuarts as failures while arguably rewriting the narrative to absolve themselves and the Hanoverians of any responsibility for their roles in forging British governance. This interpretation overlooks key contributions from the Stuarts that ultimately laid the groundwork for modern Britain. For example, the concepts of attempted religious tolerance under James I and the promotion of art and culture during Charles I’s reign helped evolve national identity.

The suggestion that royal authority must align with parliamentary interests dives deep into the core philosophy of governance. The Sovereign’s will being the Realm speaks to the notion that kings derive their authority from their subjects, a theory that both Stuarts and the works of Hobbes, Locke, and later Enlightenment thinkers helped shape. If sovereignty falters to parliamentary whim without representation of the will of the people, where does that leave the concept of monarchy? At the same time, recognizing the Hanoverians' acknowledgement of Stuart contributions only solidifies the argument that the foundations of the UK cannot be discussed without attributing due credit to the Stuart line. The narrative that positions the Hanoverians as the rightful heirs tends to diminish not only Stuart contributions but also the legitimacy of their governance altogether.

In conclusion, understanding Bonnie Prince Charlie’s motivations within the context of the Jacobite movement and the historical significance of the Stuart dynasty illustrates a far more nuanced picture than the one painted by the dominant Whig narrative. The legacy of the Stuarts should not simply be considered a series of failures; instead, we must recognize them as a vital part of the United Kingdom's identity and foundation.",0,0,0,0

"Way I see it, people who say the Sherman is a very good tank, are seriously overestimating it. I mean come on, it was nicknamed Ronson for a reason you know. Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities.

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull? Those are efforts to help augment the armour of the Sherman.",0,0,0,0

"OK, Obi-wan. You're starting to make me suspicious. What do you always ask exactly what I think are the right questions? Own up. Either way, you did not answer my question directly, and I also suspect you know it. ""Does this mean that WPO is not useful to you?"" But you did answer it indirectly. So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?
Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it.

"Karluk Yagbu State was an ancient state that emerged in the 7th century AD in Central Asia, specifically in the region of the river valleys of the Karluk Turks. It is part of the larger historical context of various Turkic states that rose and fell during this period. The state was primarily composed of various tribes related to the Karluks, a Turkic group. Karluk Yagbu, as a political entity, played a significant role in the history of the Central Asian steppes and acted as a bridge between the various cultural influences of the East and West, particularly influencing trade routes like the Silk Road..  

The Karluk Yagbu were known for their military prowess, engaging in several battles against neighboring powers to maintain their independence and dominance in the area. The state was also characterized by its unique culture that blended Turkic and Persian elements, contributing to the rich tapestry of Central Asian history. The Karluks later became integral to the formation of other notable states, such as the Ghaznavids and the Seljuks, continuing their legacy into later centuries.",0,0,0,0

Hello,
  I had gotten an e-mail from one of Western Civ's fans asking why they don't have a wikipedia page. I remembered that there had been one at one point in time so I traced it back to you. I am not an active wiki user, so I do hope you forgive my lack of knowledge on how this works. I have read the reason for deletion and I have also read all of the criteria that must be met by a band to be considered notable. If I read the deletion log correctly I see that the reason for deletion was listed as ""expired prod - borderline db-band"" That said, I am including (as references) in this message links to their three published albums, a list of press garnered and links to some of their fan pages online. If you google the words ""Western Civ"" the band is the second and third return on google. I do believe that these elements are all examples of ""Notability"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music) as Wikipedia defines it for music. Since the page ""Western Civ"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Civ is simply being used to redirect people to the ""Western Culture"" article at the moment, I do hope you will reestablish this page to it's original form, as a wiki for the band ""Western Civ""

"""The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch article in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which responds rather weakly (in my opinion): 'But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God.' It is cited in 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch with the comment: 'Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away.' The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the 'statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live' (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it. It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphrasing part of it and then adding 'as some hold'. This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case. Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at. The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this unconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so. There is a discussion at which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage. In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem passage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. One could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress. The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. Your particular POV on a Biblical passage is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion. I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history. It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions. I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound""",0,0,0,0

"""First note that my 3 books since 2002: Destiny Matrix, Dark Energy STB II, Super Cosmos, Are part of a SERIES i.e. 'Space-Time and Beyond - The Series' of which the first in 1975 (which I wrote most of the first edition of, Fred Alan Wolf did a revision years later that I did not participate in because by then the Ira Einhorn murder case broke) sold well and was published by Dutton. There is a lot of junk published by big publishers today. The only difference is that the BIG CORPORATE JUNK has few typographical and grammatical errors. But the key issue here is: Will the reader who wants to know more about me find it in my books? Obviousy yes. Furthermore there are writings of other people in my books and there are photocopies of important documents like letters from Cap Weinberger on DOD stationary, letter from Bootsie Galbraith wife of US Ambassador to France at the time on official stationary, documents from the late CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman - who BTW was the model for and wrote some of the episodes for the TV Series 'The Enforcer'.

":::::::::::::::::So what if Konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dual-pane file managers? That's not their ""normal"" (read ""preset"") mode of operation, that's why they (probably) shouldn't fall into that category. Dual-pane behaviour is part of Konqueror's functionality, not its whole functionality. You can play text-mode Tetris from within Emacs. Would you categorize Emacs as a ""Tetris clone""? As for your (conveniently abridged) definition of ""orthodox"", dual-pane file managers are not ""traditional"" in any possible meaning of the word (if there's any ""tradition"" in file management, that's either the shell or spatial file management à la classic Macintosh Finder). They certainly aren't customary nowadays, nor are they more ""generally accepted"" than other approaches. So it actually sounds like you're making my point for me there. Besides, the etymological (read ""original"") definition of ""orthodox"" is ""having the right opinion"", which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software.

It is the official German government translation of a 1937 Hitler speech. Note that ""Reich"" is always ""Reich."" The Nazis did not consider Frederick the Great as having anything to do with the First Reich. They did view him as a great German. The problem is that your case depends on what appears to you to be ""a very accurate translation.""

The expulsions were often violent and marked by significant hardship, leading to many deaths due to the harsh conditions during the migrations, which were part of the broader post-war territorial adjustments in Europe and aimed at redrawing national borders and addressing wartime grievances.",0,0,0,0

"Sorry that you feel this way, Malangali. I don't suppose that I can persuade you, but I did try and do my homework. Iringa is not offically designated a city at present (unlike Mwanza, Dar and Arusha); you asserted this in the article, but it is simply factually incorrect. A seperate question is whether Iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the Tz government's definition. OK. First, I assure you that ""urban"" can imply either town or city, particularly when contrasted with ""rural"": see urban area. I checked two English language travel guides for Tanzania, both of whom use ""town"". Moreover, I contacted some Tanzanians in Iringa, who agreed that it was ""town"" rather than a ""city"" (not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in Wikipedia, just to try and convince you that the ""town"" thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint, or whatever it is you've decided I am doing). I don't believe in individual ownership of Wikipedia articles. However, ""city"" is not the best word here, and it's entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. Again, I regret clashing with you on this, and I'm very happy to discuss and change my mind on things, and I'm glad you've improved this article, but I'm afraid I will not simply agree with whatever you say just because I'm English and you (I presume) are a Tanzanian.",0,0,0,0

Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??

""""Good Morning, Philippe. The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction. An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.
If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.

He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me. It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case.

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site. Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.
A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.
Pull LoverofArt out of this situation and I will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the NCCC site. I refuse to have further dealings with him/her.Coterminous""",0,0,0,0

LED products: random LED-based products that I'm not sure fit elsewhere (e.g. LED Incapacitator, Individually Modulated LED, LED printer, DPL Therapy)

I'm least certain of the LED products page. I was thinking to gather together a set of LED-based products that (for the most part) don't really deserve their own articles.

Hi I42 (hope I spelled it right),

you wanted deleting the article about the American Post hardcore band Save Our Souls. Well I found something which might help the article to get notable for the en:WP.

I found the official festival poster for the Sunset Strip Music Festival 2010. The band played together with bands like The Smashing Pumpkins, Volbeat, Lost Patrol, Kid Cudi and Slash. [http://pulserecordings.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/SSMF2010_Poster_11x17_web-610x924.jpg Link] there.

They will play together with Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo at the Whisky A Go-Go on the September 19tn, 2010 and they will play at the Las Vegas Hilton, where the band invited directors and producers of the Universal Studios.

"Editing

Edits on wiki improve by evolution: only the best survives. They become best by change after change after change. I find I make two kinds of edits. Ones which add content, and ones which improve language. I fancy I am quite good at writing smooth prose, but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. If I have a fact to insert or point to make, the primary thing is to make or insert it. Then someone else can smooth it along, or I may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes. As to our last exchange in Severus Snape, yes I agree, I put in a clumsy statement, but I was trying to express a particular point. You improved the flow, but slightly altered my point.

I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages. (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -)
Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJK

Someone suggested: ""Heath Robinson"" and ""Rube Goldberg"" as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ""Rube Goldberg"" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC

As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.

I think Americans certainly understand the use of ""bum"" for ""butt"", ""rubbish"" for ""trash"", and (to a lesser degree) ""flat"" for ""apartment"".  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ""that's a trash can""; a Brit will say ""that's a rubbish bin"".  Americans are more likely to use ""rubbish"" in the sense of ""bullshit"". LDC

I deleted the following pair: ""limited (Ltd)"" and ""incorporated"", since they actually mean different things. ""Incorporated"" means a corporation; ""limited"" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJK

I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.

Yes, I'd call it a ""torch"", and it would probably be labeled as a ""flashlight"" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome

Oh, so ""flashlight"" is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried ""flashlight"" only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldt",0,0,1,0
"New Aboriginal Article

Gundagai is a place of considerable reputed Aboriginal cultural significance, with both archaeological sites and anthropological associations related to sacred and spiritual beliefs of the local tribes.

Acknowledgement of country

Acknowledgement of Country is a protocol used in Australia in relation to Indigenous Australian affairs.Reconciliation Australia, 24 March 2010, Available [online] http://www.reconciliation.org.au/home/reconciliation-resources/facts-figures/q-a-factsheets/welcome-to-and-acknowledgement-of-country

The Gundagai area is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri speaking people before and post European settlement, and also holds national significance to Indigenous Australians. The floodplains of the Murrumbidgee below the present town of Gundagai were a frequent meeting place of the Wiradjuri. One indication of the ancient, sacred cultural landscape that is North Gundagai is the bora ring that has been identified close to town.

The location of Gundagai on a sizeable prehistoric highway, (the Murrumbidgee River), along with the significant and sacred Aboriginal ceremonial ground across all of North Gundagai, and other ancient archaeology, indicates it would have been an important ceremonial, mining, manufacturing and trading place for Aboriginal people before the arrival of the Europeans.Kabaila, P. (2005), 'High Country Footprints: Aboriginal pathways and movement in the high country of southeastern Australia: Recognising the ancient paths beside modern highways', Pirion Publishing Canberra As with all ancient sacred places, particularly within still continuing Australian Aboriginal culture, the sacredness of Gundagai's amazing Australian Aboriginal cultural landscape continues despite colonial and later intrusion.

Gundagai Aboriginal Elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York. Jimmy Clements also known as King Billy whose traditional name was 'Yangar',http://australianmuseum.net.au/Aboriginal-Group-Sculpture-1925 walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI of the United Kingdom and Elizabeth the Queen), and after that the two Elders were formally presented to the Royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia.http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/3853897?

Australian dialogue meeting

Aboriginal leaders Pat Dodson and Noel Pearson; the former Chief of the Australian Army and Governor of West Australia, Lieutenant General John Sanderson; and current Australian business leaders, met at a remote property on the Murrumbidgee River near Gundagai in September 2008 on the first stages of an Australian Dialogue to promote constitutional reform and structural change for Indigenous Australian people. Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Northern Territory Indigenous leader, could not be at the gathering of esteemed senior Australians but was kept informed of the progress of talks.Rintoul, S. 12 Sept 2008 'Dialogue gets under way at indigenous leaders' retreat' The Australian, http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24332900-5013172,00.html

"Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs

Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada page

Read this page for a little entertainment in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repercussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or full-stop in that page: it is ""owned"" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote ""rajput"" connection.

Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposed

His claim about Hada's character being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to their arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of bloodshed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person. He expressed his admiration (he might have said his fear) of Hada valour, alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the Rao...

If James Tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on Wikipedia?

Incident 2. Deleted the name of famous rajput lady, Maharani Gayatri Devi, from rajputani page, saying she is not a rajput.

His response: .

Impumozhi, on rajputani page deleted the name of Maharani Gayatri Devi. Then he was asked why he did so: .

His response was countered on his talk page: and till date he has not responded. The reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed.

Incident 3: Impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted, but is thwarted.

In another incident he put a tag of db-nonsense on the article Hammir Dev Chauhan. He was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the CSD tag: . No reasons given till date. Another user, , had to remove this db-nonsense tag: . Here again Impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the db-nonsense tag.",0,0,0,0

"I've been working for some time on category:Roman bridges, but you certainly provide new infos here. This is what a webpage says about the Alconetar bridge: destroyed in the 13th century, 3 arches left, moved in 1972 - I hope they did not change the arch structure then. Here the most authoritative photo: http://users.servicios.retecal.es/jomicoe/Alconetar.JPG

  El puente de Alconétar, sobre el Tajo  en Garrovillas (Cáceres) cerca de Alcántara, estaba en la Vía de la Plata. Debió de ser también monumental. Fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo XIII y nunca después reconstruido. Hoy día es un puente sin río. Al construir el pantano de Alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. En el año 1972 se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. Apenas quedan tres arcos de los 13 que tuvo. Se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones.

 As for the Pons Fabricius, there are some Roman bridges (and even more medieval ones) whose arches are designed somewhere between semi-circular and segmental. This is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day, but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. This means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types, what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semi-circle character.",0,0,0,0

However, plagiarism occurs when someone else's material is misrepresented as one own's work. How can my edits be plagiarism, since I clearly referenced the source material  Haaretz?  

I think you have confused plagiarism and copyright. From plagiarism:

Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material protected by copyright is used without consent. On the other hand, plagiarism is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship.

"Criticism

> The Oohashi et al. (2006) results reveal some interesting contradictions. While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. 

These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  )

Contrary evidence and ABX tests 

Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.   
I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. Some signals could be processed half consciously in human's brains: One feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.",0,0,0,0

"Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.

What this invitation is:
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.
What this invitation is not:
 This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations.
 This is not a vote on compromises either.

It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOS:JP talk page and helped find a solution. Thank you in advance.",0,0,0,0

"I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why? First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical ""rule nazi"" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly ""this user is an asshole"" and explain why and state ""this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"" I get blocked for 24-hours. I say ""asshole"" once, I get blocked. She calls me a ""dick"" over a dozen times, and gets warned. Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi. In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to ""wait until after TFA"" and he still ignored it. If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize ""hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA."" A little deference on his part would have gone a long way. I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine. I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful. And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth). Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time? I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's ""Will to Power"" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our. As for why, I like ""nineteenth"" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for ""brevity's sake"" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers. When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted. That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to ""kick rocks."" As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on.

As Wiki's own article for MITB states, ""the briefcase holder...can appear on any of the 3 shows to allow the case holder the chance to cash in"".

WWE has plainly stated that the case holder can pick his own spot at his own time frame to cash in.

Having that case gives CM Punk the specific right to be on Raw whenever he chooses, so he is given the chance to cash in (if he wants to do so).  That sets him apart from anybody else who pops up on Raw when it isn't his home brand.

"""Well, let's try again (one more time). Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"" ""Commonsensual"" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the ""occupation sensu stricto"" and ""occupation following an armistice"". That is what I mean under ""commonsensual"" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it. Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water. Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us: """" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation. However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to ""Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States."" What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in? Re ""there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position. Re ""From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade. Re ""Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were ""colonized"""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status? I expect you to treat my arguments seriously.",0,0,0,0

"It should be noted that traditioning in most martial arts including Muay Thai(which mostly is not a martial art anymore due to the adoption of instinctive fighting techniques of the upper body(boxing as it is called)and many other martial art techniques not exclusive to Maui Boran or Maui Tha, etc...) women are not considered true martial artists anyway. That is because the arts are designed, used, mastered, and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. A woman's training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. This is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. It is sad what has happened to Karate and TKD in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practioners(by way of parent(s), unconditioned elders, and women. But that is another debate. Regardless, female fighters are not to show any signs of claiming equality to a male fighter since the potential is clearly lacking. Like it or not, gender is of the physical, mental, and in my opinion the spiritual as well. Play to its strengths, not its weaknesses.

"I understand your point. I simply do not believe it to be valid. During the period in question, the RC Church did not have large armies at its disposal. It relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. In France, Louis, a loyal Catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. The RC Church, at this time, were also opposed to this principle (one that has become so widely accepted in 'western' societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before). Louis, with the tactic support of leading Churchman, ordered acts of anti-Protestant terror. (Let's be completely honest, without the tactic approval of the Church, would a devout Catholic have been committed to such a course of action?) Some leading Churchman celebrated the outcome - a France almost completely 'cleansed' of Protestants. Now, in all the material the criticism of the RC Church is so obviously implied that this shouldn't need re-emphasising.

"I am appealing a 48-hour block that was placed on me before I could post my response via the administrator's message board. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I believe that it's necessary to include all of these details. I wrote a summary at the end so that administrator's could get an overview if they don't have time to read the whole statement.

I will be addressing the claim that I violated the 1RR rule in the second paragraph of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shapira

According to WP:BLP, ""Biographies of living persons must be written conservatively and with regard to a subject's privacy..."" In a book written in a foreign language, with a lot of jargon, there are often competing translations/interpretations. And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.

With that in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.

user:Zero0000 - responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I ""can't read.""] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.""Take a break"" I didn't take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had ""behavioral problems.""
Said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics ""I started to write a complaint against you"" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn't like by saying that ""it was on my charge sheet.""

Now the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue: After posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.

I will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:

Source: ""There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side""]

user:Zero0000: [""Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .""]

After those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion.

And when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement ""may be done"" and ""there is a reason"" is even greater.

Aside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.

Why did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement: (prefer source with an actual quotation)

As I showed above, he didn't use an actual quotation.

Furthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn't able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation.

His actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me ""take a break"").",0,0,0,0

"I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldn't be a problem with it? Particularly, I imagine, if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?

I read each of the candidates statements, and used that to judge if this question would be useful, look at the time between asking the candidates questions. Also look at the ""ignore all evidence"" question, this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the ""5 days"" question, plus this shows it was not a ""spam"" question to all candidates, I did pay attention to their statements.

This is the question I posed to select candidates.
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?

Do these quotes;

ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?

Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes?

If an essay WP:IGNORE ALL THE EVIDENCE were written, what concerns would be behind it, and what could be done about them? 
If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days, then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates, substituting this with that example. Would that be acceptable?

Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? Or is this the only one? Of course to answer that you would also have to answer; can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI? If you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do, or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self?  ",0,0,0,0

"New Louisville definition Since the Census Bureau has clearly defined the new Louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas, I think there some details needed that need to be added defining Metro Government. First, it is important to note that a KY Legislative bill (dubbed the Lyndon Bill) prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. If this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left. Second, this definition won't effect the new city's population growth, since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. Third, even if Suburban cities don't count toward the population, their residents can still vote for Metro mayor and council members, and will still receive Metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services. Personally, I think the official municipality (the entire county) is what should make up this article, regardless of what the Census Bureau says. The smaller article with the ""balance"" is what should have the information for the census-defined city. Your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. What you are referring to is the Louisville-Jefferson County balance, which is not the same thing as consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County. Both are defined separately by the Census Bureau (see here). This article is about the consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County (which is how the city is legally incorporated). The confusion lies in the Census Bureau's use of balance figures when ranking cities, rather than the consolidated figures. (Although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings.) The Census Bureau has accepted the Louisville/ Jefferson balance, but not the City/County Consolidation, which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and won't be in future censuses. Because of the acceptence of the Lou/Jef Balance, my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. If this were not the case then the Balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs. Your assertion is not entirely correct. The Census Bureau does, in fact, include the entire consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County in their estimates. They also include a separate figure for the balance: 170,Louisville/Jefferson County,Kentucky,A,693604,693872,694757,695843,698059,698903,699827 162,Louisville/Jefferson County (balance),Kentucky,A,551183,551390,552058,552828,554381,555366,556429 That's from the 2005 estimates (the last number is the 2005 estimated population). This article is not about the balance, however. Issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance article's talk page. Actual Population There are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. According to the Census bureau estimates, the balance population is 556,429 and not anywhere near 700,000. What is the actual city proper population, as that is to be what is listed? I do not believe that Louisville has a population anywhere near that of Columbus, Ohio. We need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. There are several pages in Wikipedia listing the population as 699,000 (or so), when the Census lists the population as 556,429. I understand that several people (especially those who live in the area) want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. If it was a city I lived in, I would like to do the same. However, that cannot be done here. An actual, correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. If we are able to, we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. I am a little confused myself, and I did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed. There have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article. Please, for the sake of your own knowledge, read all the talk archives that cover this situation. Since there is a consensus that's currently overwhelmingly not in your favor, you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — [[User:Stevietheman|",0,0,0,0

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

"Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books.

"In your discussion about the relevance of the criticism presented in the context of the TV2 series 'Sensing Murder,' you raise valid points regarding the credibility of the sources of skepticism. While the show does include critiques of the psychic mediums involved, the reliance on a television presenter for such criticism doesn't necessarily carry the same weight as insights from experts in relevant fields such as psychology, criminology, or the scientific community. Furthermore, the absence of information about the reputation or track record of the mediums cited may detract from the legitimacy of the claims made.

It seems that the criticism may be bolstered by anecdotal evidence rather than substantial, objective analysis. As such, the skepticism featured could be seen as less authoritative on its own, particularly without the backing of verified case outcomes or peer-reviewed assessments. Therefore, while the inclusion of this criticism contributes to a more rounded view of the series, it might not be sufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of psychics in solving cases without more solid evidence or reputable critiques.

Wendy, however, reassures Stan of her commitment to him, indicating that she has no intention of leaving. If someone suggested they broke up after this episode, it reflects a misunderstanding of the narrative, especially given Wendy's clear communication about her feelings.

In discussions about the episode, it's important to pay attention to the dynamics showcased, where Wendy's affirmation of her feelings towards Stan counters any notions of a breakup. Thus, it seems that any claims of their breakup are unlikely, based on their interactions in that episode.",0,0,0,0

"Locations Thailand. While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism. Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism. I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit. I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more ""sex for money"" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase ""sex tourism"" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion. Note that ""bar girls"" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also. Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves ""rented wifes"" albeit for ""short time"" rather then ""long time"". I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and rented wifes particularly of the ""long-term"" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the ""wifes"" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both. There is no such thing as a free lunch and ""everybody pays for it"". [Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise). The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as ""sex tourism"" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call ""Giesha cultures"": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus ""Virgin cultures"" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard aren't we all! but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.) Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also. I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more ""exploitation"" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]",0,0,0,0

"""To Cool Hand Luke: I ask for your help as an administrator with this problem. From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines: Deletion process Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policy Deletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required. I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that ""any user"" can ""contest"" the proposal by ""removing"" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it. I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies. The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are ""no emergencies on Wikipedia,"" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article. In fact the redirect was effect as I was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay, and when I hit save, the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost; (6) he gave me three rapid succession warnings (in bad faith, for what I believe were good faith acts on my part) and had me blocked before I could make a response to his ""warnings""; it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users. It seems quite clear in light of the above, and further facts that can be marshalled in support, that this user's intent is (1) not supported by facts or policies, (2) not in good faith, (3) in retaliation, and therefore (5) in violation of Wikipedia policy. Recognizing this, I communicated to this user that I would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement, by not making any further comment on the talk page of Tort Reform. I had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not, as the user had made the dispute personal. As for my being blocked by you as per the 3-revert rule, I must point out that I do not believe the rule applies to what I did, because I was (1) making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption, (2) the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user's (his) apparent violations; (3) rather than reply, he deleted the warnings and requests to stop; (4) did so more than three times, in violation of the rule; (5) in bad faith, turned the rule on meI did not delete anything, and technically, I did not revert anything either, I think, but was adding to previous posts, and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a NEW post. Other indications of bad faith: The user asserts that I committed ""vandalism"" to the entry on Sonic's Rendezvous Band by removing the delete tags. My reply is (1) I did so in accordance with policy; (2) it is not ""vandalism"" to remove",0,0,0,0

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of deletion, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit that page as you would any other. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.

Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html and here is a long and in-depth article:
http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html

Her real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.

I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.

Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths. 

What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent ""The Face"" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in ""The Severed Alliance"", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in ""Songs That Saved Your Life"" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: ""Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere."" 

However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.",0,0,0,0

However, if there is some content worth preserving, you could consider merging it with Ouse Valley Eagles, making sure to provide a clear rationale and proper citations for any relevant information.

Franklin was indeed associated with the Pennsylvania Gazette as he owned and published it in the 18th century. Furthermore, the mention of dedicating a proposed volume to Franklin suggests a close relationship with his work. Jefferson, while a significant historical figure, did not have a direct connection to the Pennsylvania Gazette in the same capacity.

"The Othello Error highlights the complexities of interpreting emotional responses during questioning, especially in scenarios where fear or distress may not accurately reflect honesty or deceit. This concept arises from the tragic story of Othello, who, driven by jealousy and misinterpretation of his wife's emotional state, commits a grave act based on incorrect assumptions. This underscores the importance of critical evaluation of behavioral cues, as honest individuals may display signs of distress under scrutiny, leading to false conclusions about their truthfulness. Thus, it is essential to consider a broader context rather than relying solely on surface-level emotional indicators when assessing credibility.",0,0,0,0

"The Signature of the Atomic Bomb There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.",0,0,0,0

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

"I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).

On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.
As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.

And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish ""Viking"" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.

Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.

Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.",0,0,0,0

"""Cadaver sanguisugus"" is a term that appears to be linked to discussions around vampiric lore, particularly in historical contexts. The term itself is Latin, roughly translating to ""blood-sucking corpse,"" which would fit well within the scope of vampire mythology. However, the request here is for scholarly validation of the term's usage, specifically in the works of William de Newburgh.

In your query, you mention that the term ""sanguisuga"" translates to ""a leech,"" which is quite relevant as it evokes the image of blood-sucking entities. As of my last knowledge update, I don’t have direct references or sources that confirm ""cadaver sanguisugus"" appears in the works of William de Newburgh himself, or any scholarly interpretation indicating that specifically. It might be worth exploring medieval texts focused on vampirism, blood rituals, and leech symbolism, as well as consulting databases of Latin literature and historical analyses of Newburgh's works.

If this is a specific line of inquiry, checking academic papers or historical lexicons might produce some leads, along with specialist texts on the evolution of the vampire myth in medieval literature. You may also want to look at more extensive medieval manuscript studies or anthologies discussing the legend of vampires in Christian Europe.

In summary: while the term ""cadaver sanguisugus"" seems both fitting and intriguing in the context of vampire lore, finding a scholarly source that directly ties it to Newburgh or that establishes its historical usage may need further specialized research.",0,0,0,0

Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010.

Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation).

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

I have stated that the editor has maintained his own personal views into the article.

How can a person cite a scholar and then reject my use of the same scholar when it doesn't fit in with his own POV, which he stated as only being orthodox? I know wiki also has information on the Shia unorthodox sect of Islam, does that mean we only adhere to one person's view on Sikhism?

"I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use ""Province of Lower Silesia"" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in ""real life"" the use of ""voivodeship"" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. ""Voivodeship"" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.

"External links on ballet

Hello! External links are often taken as a ""For further reading"" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't. The Ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite, and any help you could offer would be appreciated (see the talk page and WikiProject Ballet's article improvement page for more information on what needs doing).

"Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:
""Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's ""cowboy father"", the ""family dog"", an ""inept thief"", and ""abused monkey"""" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.
""Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and ""thing"", and opens to a ""pastoral forest village"" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village. With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot. They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army. Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like ""partying ghosts"" and ""talking rope snakes"". Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear."" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that. 
The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until ""Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor."" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.
""There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles"" - First of all, this should start off with a ""However"" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this.
"" and lets the player see their magic ""PSI power"" abilities"" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon? 
""While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects."" - By ""completely new"" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.
If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following:
Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada. 
Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?). 
Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle. 
Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.",0,0,0,0

"Nazeh Darwazi was a dedicated camera operator for the Associated Press, known for his courageous reporting from some of the most volatile regions in the world. Born in the Palestinian territories, he became a prominent figure in documenting the Second Intifada, a period of intense conflict that erupted in late 2000 between Israelis and Palestinians.

Darwazi's work was characterized by his commitment to truth and transparency, often placing himself in perilous situations to capture the realities of life in the occupied territories. His footage provided vital insights into the struggles faced by ordinary people amid the chaos of conflict, and his stories resonated with audiences globally, highlighting the human cost of war.

On [insert date], while covering events in Nablus, Darwazi tragically lost his life when he was shot. His untimely death was a stark reminder of the dangers faced by journalists in conflict zones, where the pursuit of a story can be as perilous as the stories themselves. 

The journalism community mourned his loss, recognizing not only the sacrifice he made in his profession but also the impact of his work in illuminating the truth behind the headlines. In the wake of his passing, there have been renewed calls for safeguarding journalists' rights and protecting those who risk their lives to inform the world.

Nazeh Darwazi's legacy lives on through the footage he captured, the stories he told, and the crucial role he played in bringing awareness to the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His dedication to journalism serves as an enduring inspiration for aspiring reporters and activists alike, reminding us of the profound power of storytelling in bringing about change.",0,0,0,0

"Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish. Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology. A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people. And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century. Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry. His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works. Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that. While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one. His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever). Marx was German of Jewish descent. Being an ""internationalist"" is a statement of intentions for the future of the world, not of present day identity.",0,0,0,0

Please be aware that WP:ATT (like any other WP policy) isn’t written in stone, and SaltyBoatr's extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say.
every article published in Foreign Affairs is reviewed by other scientists, which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. That should be enough to make sure WP:ATT isn’t a good reason to ban them.
I have to agree with Ultramarine: if you use your interpretation of WP:ATT consequently, there’s only a handful of WP-articles that would survive the necessary mass-deletion of references. (What’s more, I think it would be some pretty bad ones, those that rely entirely on newspaper articles)

"Kurdistan?

Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish ""state"" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.",0,0,0,0

"Where do you see Dennis saying ""step it up""?

""Stepping it up"" and/or ""bumping it up"" has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you.  Nor do any of the other comments by Dennis even suggest such a thing be done, or has been done.

Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the ""academic geek created/mindless computer driven"" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar ""theory"" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from ""The Prophet"" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the ""hard"" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called ""black swan events"") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the ""mad money"" crowd.  ",0,0,1,0

"In late 2010, the Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding was removed from the park, likely as part of a strategic shift by Six Flags, particularly for the Great Escape park, which may not have had the same branding integration as other Six Flags parks. This decision raised questions among fans and visitors, given that those characters were still utilized in other Six Flags locations. The reasoning behind this change could be tied to the park's operational strategies, cost considerations, or a move to develop a unique identity for The Great Escape that sets it apart from the standard Six Flags experience. It is also possible that they wanted to experiment with different themes or revive older branding that may appeal more to their audience, hence the removal of the well-known brands. This shift in branding may reflect a broader trend in the amusement park industry to attract visitors with novelty and variety, rather than relying solely on recognizable characters. Jacob Chesley the Alternate Historian might consider that even though the Great Escape is owned by Six Flags, its operational identity could benefit from a distinct approach, thus making a case for the discontinuation of such branding.",0,0,0,0

"Niles' adherence to the term Democratic-Republican despite his departure from the party signifies a complex relationship with political identity and language. His choice to avoid party propaganda suggests a commitment to clarity and reason in political discourse at a time when partisan rhetoric was increasingly divisive. The fact that he distanced himself from both major factions within the party by 1824 further illustrates his unique position; he was not bound by the conflicting ideologies and rivalries that characterized the political landscape of his time. This departure from Jacksonian Democrats allows for a deeper exploration of the evolution of political labels and their meanings. Niles' example serves as a reminder of the fluidity of political affiliations and the importance of principles over party politics. His use of a term so closely associated with a party he no longer identifies with reflects a broader shift in political language and the implications that come with it.
